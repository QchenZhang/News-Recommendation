            "body": "Christian Borle, surrounded by the rest of the cast of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.\" (Joan Marcus) NEW YORK - What are Christian Borle and Ramin Karimloo doing in these brand-extension kiddie clunkers? Collecting hefty salaries, one hopes! Because both actors are spinning their talented wheels in overproduced musicals for young audiences that just had their official openings on Broadway. \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" with Borle (TV's \"Smash\") as criminally negligent confectioner Willy Wonka, opened Sunday night at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre. And \"Anastasia\" offers Karimloo (Tony-nominated in 2014 for the revival of \"Les Miserables\") in the dreary role of a Communist apparatchik on the trail of an amnesiac Russian royal. It had its opening Monday night two blocks away, at the Broadhurst Theatre. Both shows are lumbering follow-ups to movies, with some numbers from the big-screen versions still attached. Both are staged by directors with distinguished r\u00e9sum\u00e9s - Jack O'Brien for \"Charlie,\" Darko Tresnjak for \"Anastasia\" - working from scores by songwriting partnerships with deep Broadway roots. Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman (\"Hairspray\") contribute the score for \"Charlie\" (with some tunes, including \"Candy Man,\" by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley from the 1971 film \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\"). Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (\"Ragtime\") wrote the film and stage songbooks for \"Anastasia.\" Although they share estimable pedigrees, the musicals fail in different ways. \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\" from the 1964 Roald Dahl novel, imagines itself cleverly subversive, but it's just a shrill and nasty cartoon. The production labors under the illusion that killing off irritating children in a candy factory is hilarious, when instead it comes across as one indulgent act of mean-spiritedness. A protracted Act 1 in which little Wonka-worshiping Charlie (Ryan Foust, one of three young actors alternating in the role) wins one of the golden tickets to tour Willy's factory, gives way in Act 2 to what can only be described as sugarcoated grand guignol. The funny business includes drowning in chocolate a child who would have been better directed to a meeting of Overeaters Anonymous. Borle wears a disconcerted look throughout much of the proceedings, as if he just finished a meal that didn't agree with him. I like to think he, too, wonders what he's doing there. \"Anastasia,\" based loosely on the 1997 animated movie of the same title, isn't quite as tone- deaf. It's just dull. Legend has it that when Czar Nicholas was executed along with his wife and children in the wake of the Russian Revolution, one daughter, Anastasia (played here blandly by Christy Altomare) survived. Terrence McNally's book posits the revolutionary government as fearful of a potential heiress to the monarchy reappearing and rallying the populace, and so sends Karimloo's Gleb to eliminate her. Anastasia, meanwhile, suffering from total memory loss, is recruited (coincidentally) by a pair of good-natured scammers (Derek Klena and John Bolton) who school her in royal behavior, in an effort to present her in Paris as Anastasia to the grieving Dowager Empress (Mary Beth Peil). Except she really is Anastasia. For almost certain. (Spoiler alert: Whether she is or not, the musical never makes you care.) Russia in the years after the Communist takeover apparently was not only haggard and poverty-ridden; it also was afflicted with permanent cloudy weather. Because there's just one dark day after another in the desultory St. Petersburg of \"Anastasia.\" Only when Anastasia and her confederates reach Paris - the City of Light - do Alexander Dodge's sets brighten. The show, though, has few illuminating ideas of its own: At various times, the musical interludes remind you of better moments in \"My Fair Lady,\" \"Fiddler on the Roof\" and \"Les Miz.\" Not even my daughter, who loved the movie version as a child, fell for the tortured make-believe mechanics of this \"Anastasia.\" Ramin Karimloo and Christy Altomare in \"Anastasia\" (Matthew Murphy) Anastasia, book by Terrence McNally, music by Stephen Flaherty, lyrics by Lynn Ahrens.

            "body": "President Trump on April 20 said Canada's trade practices on dairy, lumber, and energy are unfair to the United States. \"We're going to have to get to the negotiating table with Canada very, very quickly,\" Trump said. (The Washington Post) The Trump administration announced on Monday that it is planning to impose a roughly 20 percent tariff on softwood lumber imported from Canada, a new escalation of trade tensions with America's northern neighbor. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in an interview that his department had reached a preliminary decision to impose the tax, the administration's first major trade action against Canada. Ross portrayed the action as a tough measure to punish Canada after President Trump declared last week that \"we can't let Canada or anybody else take advantage and do what they did to our workers and to our farmers.\" \"What we are doing is dealing with another bad act on the part of the Canadians,\" Ross said. The Obama administration began the review of trade in softwood lumber last year out of concern that Canada was subsidizing its wood industry in a way that hurt U.S. rivals. The decision to impose what are known as \"countervailing duties\" in retaliation for Canada's wood subsidies, which will be announced Tuesday, is subject to a final review by the International Trade Commission, an independent federal agency that advises the government on trade policy. Yet the decision allows U.S. Customs and Border Protection to begin collecting the funds from Canadian importers immediately. Five Canadian companies were a part of the investigation, and the United States will seek to collect money from four of them retroactively for actions taken in the past 90 days, Ross said. Ross said this could amount to $1 billion in new tariffs, as well as $250 million in retroactive collections. All other Canadian softwood lumber companies will face the same tariff of 19.88 percent going forward. Softwood lumber is a major export of Canada, which sold $5.8 billion in lumber to the United States last year, giving it about 31.5 percent of the U.S. market. It's the fourth largest export from Canada to the United States after oil, gas and cars. After spending much of his presidential campaign attacking China and Mexico for their trade practices, Trump has shifted his ire toward Canada in the past week. Trump blasted Canada's recent decision to impose import taxes on ultra-filtered milk, a move he said was \"very, very unfair\" to the U.S. dairy industry. Ross said that Trump saw how hard this was hitting U.S. farmers during a recent trip to Wisconsin and was moved by their reaction. But Ross also added that the softwood lumber action was decided on its own \"merits.\" The ruling is the latest salvo in a decades-long battle between Canadian and American lumber producers. U.S. lumber producers, who are mostly based in the Northwest, have long complained that Canada unfairly subsidizes its lumber by selling wood from government land at low rates to Canadian lumber producers, leading to a loss of jobs in the United States. The Canadians have argued that, despite decades of investigations and litigation, U.S. claims about Canada's unfair practices in the lumber trade have not stood up to scrutiny at the World Trade Organization. Canada's minister of natural resources and minister of foreign affairs jointly issued a statement Monday calling the U.S. accusations against Canadian lumber \"baseless and unfounded.\" \"The Government of Canada will vigorously defend the interests of the Canadian softwood lumber industry, including through litigation... We have prevailed in the past and we will do so again,\" the statement said. Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, predicted that the dispute would not escalate into something much bigger. \"I don't think it will be a trade war with Canada,\" Bown said. \"This is an irritant that is always there between these two countries, and Canada knows that.\" Jeffrey Schott, a former Treasury official and trade negotiator, said the tariff would likely translate into higher costs for U.S. consumers. \"This will put upward pressure on prices for the main consumer of softwood lumber, and that would be the housing industry. So the cost of housing will go up to some extent,\" he said.",

            "body": "Former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly said on a podcast Monday that he is \"very confident the truth will come out.\" (Richard Drew/AP) Bill O'Reilly is as defiant as ever. On the day he was originally scheduled to return to Fox News from vacation, the deposed King of Cable News spoke out on a podcast Monday night about the sexual harassment allegations that led to his ouster and hinted at a campaign to clear his name. O'Reilly's highly anticipated remarks (heavy traffic temporarily crashed his website) did not resemble the launch of an apology tour - not in the least. They sounded more like the start of a revenge tour. Here's the relevant excerpt from the podcast: I am sad that I'm not on television anymore. I was very surprised how it all turned out. I can't say a lot, because there's much stuff going on right now. But I can tell you that I'm very confident the truth will come out, and when it does, I don't know if you're going to be surprised - but I think you're going to be shaken, as I am. There's a lot of stuff involved here. Now, I can't say any more because I just don't want to influence the flow of the information. I don't want the media to take what I say and misconstrue it. However you, as a loyal O'Reilly listener, have a right to know, I think, down the lane what exactly happened. And we are working in that direction, okay? It is important to note that there is no clear reason O'Reilly \"can't say any more.\" The harassment allegations, chronicled in a New York Times report earlier this month, already have been settled. O'Reilly's reported $25 million severance from Fox News presumably precludes him from suing the network, so there is no pending litigation that we know of. When O'Reilly says \"the truth will come out,\" he is not talking about the conclusion of some ongoing lawsuit. It appears that he is talking about an effort on his part to cast himself as the victim of some kind of left-wing conspiracy. That was a strategy mulled by O'Reilly's legal team during negotiations with Fox News, according to an email obtained by Politico. It looks as if O'Reilly is determined to make the case publicly that he was unjustly targeted, smeared and ruined by his liberal detractors. Clearly we have not heard the last of O'Reilly, and he won't be sitting down to tell Barbara Walters or Oprah Winfrey how sorry he is anytime soon.",

            "body": "The White House sought Monday to calm a jittery Washington ahead of a showdown with Congress over spending, and President Trump softened his demand that a deal to keep the federal government open include money to begin construction on his long-promised border wall. Despite one-party control at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, the brinkmanship that came to define spending battles in the Obama years has tumbled into the Trump era, as have the factional divisions over strategy and priorities that have gripped the GOP for a decade. But with a Friday deadline looming to pass a new spending bill, the Trump administration projected confidence that a shutdown would be avoided. In the face of fierce Democratic opposition to funding the wall's construction, White House officials signaled Monday that the president may be open to an agreement that includes money for border security if not specifically for a wall, with an emphasis on technology and border agents rather than a structure. Trump showed even more flexibility Monday afternoon, telling conservative journalists in a private meeting that he was open to delaying funding for wall construction until September, a White House official confirmed. \"The president is working hard to keep the government open,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters Monday. White House press secretary Sean Spicer said he was \"very confident\" that an agreement would be reached by Friday, but he pointedly said he could not \"guarantee\" that a government closure would be averted. President Trump and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley arrive for a White House luncheon with ambassadors from countries on the U.N. Security Council. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) At issue is whether the spending measure will explicitly allocate funds toward building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border - a campaign promise that was a rallying cry for Trump's base and one on which he is eager to demonstrate progress by Saturday, his 100th day in office. Democrats, meanwhile, gave the White House an opening, saying they would agree to some new money for border security - so long as it did not go toward the creation of a wall, something House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has called \"immoral.\" In a speech on the Senate floor, Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) blasted the idea of a wall while suggesting that a combination of smart technology and law enforcement, including the use of drones, would be \"a much more effective way to secure the border\" without hitting an impasse in Congress. Republicans were working to define Trump's campaign promise down, arguing that any form of border security would fulfill it. \"There will never be a 2,200-mile wall built, period,\" said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a supporter of immigration reform who challenged Trump in the 2016 primaries. \"I think it's become symbolic of better border security. It's a code word for better border security. If you make it about actually building a 2,200-mile wall, that's a bridge too far - but I'm mixing my metaphors.\" Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), a key appropriator and member of Senate leadership, said that \"there could be a wall in some places and technology in other places,\" implying that there would not be funding for the wall sketched out in campaign rhetoric. \"I think you're going to get a down payment on border security generally,\" he said. Trump has asked Congress for $1.5 billion in new money to start construction on the wall, and he wants an additional $2.6 billion for the fiscal year that begins in October. The wall, experts say, would cost $21.6 billion and take 3\u00bd years to construct. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said technology and law enforcement, including the use of drones, would be \"a much more effective way to secure the border.\" (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) At the White House, Spicer portrayed Trump's position not as a demand but rather as one of two priorities - the other being additional military funding - in evolving negotiations with Congress. He left open the possibility that the president could agree to funding for border activities generally, such as additional fencing or drones. \"I'm not going to get ahead of the negotiations that are ongoing,\" Spicer said. Should lawmakers fail to find consensus by Friday, there are plans ready to quickly pass through the House and Senate what is referred to as a \"short-term C.R.,\" a continuing resolution to keep the government open until discussions are finalized. The Senate returned Monday night and the House returns Tuesday from a two-week recess, leaving only three days this week when both chambers will be in session. The more conciliatory language emanating from the White House did not stop Trump from continuing to hammer away on Twitter at what he claims is an urgent need for the wall. In a pair of posts, Trump sought to build public pressure on lawmakers to pass funding for wall construction. \"The Wall is a very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth (and many others)!\" he wrote in a morning post. In another message several hours later, Trump wrote that if \"the wall is not built, which it will be, the drug situation will NEVER be fixed the way it should be! #BuildTheWall.\" Still, Trump has left himself wiggle room to agree to sign a government funding bill that does not include money for the wall. \"My base understands the wall is going to get built, whether I have it funded here or if I get it funded shortly thereafter,\" Trump said in a recent interview with the Associated Press. \"That wall's getting built, okay? One hundred percent.\" Asked if he would sign a bill without wall funding, Trump told the news service, \"I just don't know yet.\" The debate over wall funding is just one of several moving pieces congressional leaders are trying to address this week to avoid a partial government shutdown. In 2015, President Barack Obama made a deal with congressional lawmakers to fund government operations through April 28, 2017. If a new agreement isn't reached by then, many federal employees will stop being paid, national parks will close, and a number of other changes will kick in - as in 2013, the last time the government shut down. Since new rules about spending bills went into place after Jimmy Carter's administration, a government shutdown has never occurred when a single political party has controlled the White House and both chambers of Congress. Paramount for many Republican lawmakers is funding the government, as opposed to the wall specifically. If the government shuts down, they fear, voters could blame the GOP for failing to govern, and the party could suffer the consequences in the 2018 midterm elections. \"I'd like to make it as clean as we can and fund the government,\" said Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.). \"I wouldn't mind funding the wall, but it's a question of what we can do. The question is, what's doable and will we make the deadline?\" Sen. James E. Risch (R-Idaho) said that an effective \"wall\" along the border had been \"authorized years and years and years ago,\" in the Secure Fence Act of 2006. \"It's been partially built and partially funded. He wants to fund the rest of it and build it - perfectly legitimate debate that should take place on that,\" Risch said. Asked if that debate could happen in three days, Risch chuckled. \"Things get done quickly around here when they want it to get done,\" he said. Even when Republicans controlled the House during the Obama administration, they could rarely pass spending bills without Democratic support. That is because a number of the House's most conservative members often refused to support such bills, making a bipartisan majority coalition a necessity. In addition, 60 votes are needed to pass a requisite procedural vote in the Senate. With just 52 seats, Senate Republicans will need bipartisan support in that chamber as well. Among other guarantees, Democrats want assurances that insurance subsidies through the Affordable Care Act will continue to be funded. There have been discussions among Republicans that Democrats could agree to provide money for the construction of the wall in exchange for those health funds, but Democrats have refused. Sunday morning, congressional Democrats submitted to Republicans a compromise spending plan, which included some new money for border security but only if it did not go toward a wall. Democrats also asked for assurances that the health insurance subsidies would continue to be funded, language that would shore up benefits for coal miners and a change that would expand Medicaid benefits to people in Puerto Rico, according to a senior Democratic congressional aide. Pelosi told reporters on a conference call Monday that Congress was \"on the path to get it done until [Trump] did intervene\" and that the administration's actions so far belied his campaign promise to \"make Mexico pay\" for the border wall. James Norton, a former deputy assistant undersecretary for homeland security under President George W. Bush, said funding for technologies, such as cameras and radars, on the border has dropped off since the early 2000s. He said to get money for the wall or other border security measures, the administration will have to \"sell specifics\" to lawmakers. \"Each part is going to need to be sold in a specific way to Congress, and they're going to have to hit the Hill hard,\" Norton said. \"It won't be easy.\" Damian Paletta and Sean Sullivan contributed to this report.

(Elsa/Getty Images) DENVER - The Nationals arrived at their Denver hotel early Monday morning, not long before sunrise and not as much before Monday's first pitch at 8:40 p.m. ET local time as they might have liked. Sunday's overnight trip is one of the many challenges of this 10-game road trip, one around which Manager Dusty Baker has been planning for weeks. In keeping with his plan, he held Bryce Harper and Matt Wieters out of Monday's lineup in an effort to preserve them both moving forward. Harper has played in every game this season. Wieters rested Friday night and will likely rest again against the Rockies this week, Baker said. [Bryce Harper named National League player of the week] \"Wieters is at a grueling position. He'll play tomorrow, then he might be off the next day,\" said Baker, who acknowledged that Wieters provides a strong pinch-hitting option if the timing is right. \"We have to make sure they can't walk him or pitch around him,\" Baker said. \"Or try not to double switch him in there. That negates the day off.\" Meanwhile, Trea Turner will return to the top spot in the Nationals' batting order Monday night. When Turner returned from the disabled list this weekend, Baker hit him second, hoping to take some pressure off Turner's hamstrings and let Eaton carry the leadoff load. Monday night, Turner is back in his usual leadoff spot with Eaton batting second. In 12 games leading off in Turner's absence, Eaton hit .300 with a .759 OPS. [Boswell: Closer issues aside, Nationals are answering all questions emphatically] Turner's intended backup at shortstop, Stephen Drew, took steps toward a return from his hamstring injury Monday. The 34-year-old shuffled and jogged in the outfield, and Baker acknowledged that the veteran infielder was increasing activity levels. Drew hit the disabled list on April 12 with hamstring trouble. The other Washington player on the disabled list, Sammy Solis, threw lightly in the outfield before Monday's game. Baker did not have an update on the lefty, other than to say he is \"chomping at the bit\" to get him back in the bullpen. Without Harper and Wieters in the lineup, Michael A. Taylor and Jose Lobaton will get their chance against Rockies left-hander Tyler Anderson. None of the Nationals has faced him before.

            "body": "Montgomery election officials said Monday they will review registration procedures in response to allegations from a conservative watchdog group that the county's rolls are packed with ineligible voters. Judicial Watch said in a letter earlier this month there was \"strong circumstantial evidence\" that Montgomery's lists are filled with names of voters who have died, moved out of state or are non-citizens. It said the charge is supported by data showing more registered voters in the county than there are citizens of voting age (18 and over). The group said it would sue the state of Maryland within 90 days unless officials show they have taken action to clean up voter lists and come into compliance with the National Voter Registration Act. Montgomery is one of more than 90 counties in 11 states hit with similar allegations by Judicial Watch. Montgomery County, where Democrats have a 2-to-1 registration advantage - is the only Maryland jurisdiction that was served notice. \"Voter fraud is totally unacceptable. \"We take this issue very seriously.\" said Board President James Shalleck, a Republican appointed by Gov. Larry Hogan (R). Under state law, the party that controls the governor's office holds the majority on state and local election boards. The state board, which oversees county panels, said last week that it will also review practices in response to Judicial Watch. But county election staff and voting rights groups raised questions Monday about the legitimacy of Judicial Watch's claim. Records do show that Montgomery's total registration of 657,548 is higher than its voting-age population of 633,295, a figure that comes from census data. But board staff said there as many as 16,000 active voters who don't show up in the census. About half are 16-and-17-year olds allowed to register because they will be 18 by the time of the next federal election. The other half includes county voters overseas, either with the military or the private sector. The disconnect between registration and voting-age population also reflects the lengthy process required by federal law remove someone from the voter rolls, board staff said. It takes four years to \"cancel,\" or remove a person from voter lists. That comes only after two sample ballots are returned with no forwarding address and the individual fails to vote in two consecutive federal elections. Overall, the county has removed more than 76,000 voters from the rolls since 2015. The board has received letters and comment from voting rights groups challenging Judicial Watch's analysis. Sarah Brannon, director of government agency voter registration for Project Vote, told the board Monday that the National Voter Registration Act, also known as the \"motor voter\" law, was intended to expand access to voting. The two Democrats on the five-member board agreed that there should be no tolerance for fraud or sloppy practices. But they cautioned that ill-conceived sweeps of the rolls could inadvertently disenfranchise eligible voters. \"We also don't have a tolerance for removing people from the rolls unless we're absolutely sure,\" said board member David Naimon. In public comments, some speakers demanded an aggressive investigation and more. Montgomery County Republican chair Dick Jurgena called for the board to fire elections director Margaret Jurgensen. \"I think the draining of the swamp needs to start here and now,\" Jurgena said. \"This performance on the part of at least some of your staff is unacceptable.\" Board members did not respond to his call for the ouster of Jurgensen, who at the beginning of the meeting received a special citation for her 15 years of service.",

            "body": "The State Department on Monday removed from its website an article about the history and lavish furnishings of President Trump's privately owned Florida resort club Mar-a-Lago, following questions about whether the federal government improperly promoted Trump's moneymaking enterprises. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) pointed to the travelogue-style blog piece Monday, asking in a Twitter message why the State Department would spend \"taxpayer $$ promoting the president's private country club.\" The State Department issued a statement Monday apologizing for \"any misperception.\" \"The intention of the article was to inform the public about where the president has been hosting world leaders,\" the statement said. It was not clear whether the item had been vetted for legal or ethical concerns. The short item had been posted on a promotional website called \"Share America\" on April 4, ahead of Trump's meeting at Mar-a-Lago with Chinese President Xi Jinping. A version of the item was recently reposted on the website maintained by the U.S. Embassy in London, where it caught the attention of watchdog groups. The item adopted Trump's term \"winter White House\" for the -members-only club. It did not expressly encourage foreigners to visit Mar-a-Lago, although other articles on the same website actively promote U.S. tourism. The item did note that the estate \"is located at the heart of Florida's Palm Beach community.\" \"By visiting this 'winter White House,' Trump is belatedly fulfilling the dream of Mar-a-Lago's original owner and designer,\" the item read. \"The ornate Jazz Age house was designed with Old-World Spanish, Venetian and Portuguese influences\" and filled with original owner Marjorie Merriweather Post's collection of antiques, the article noted. The item included photographs of the house and sumptuous interiors, and copies of Trump tweets mentioning Mar-a-Lago. The article gave a brief summary of the 1927 mansion's history, including Post's desire that it be used by U.S. presidents as a retreat and the subsequent decision by the U.S. government that the property was too expensive to maintain. Trump bought it in 1985. \"After refurbishing the house and adding an events space, Trump opened the estate to dues-paying members of the public in 1995 as the Mar-a-Lago Club,\" the State Department item read. \"Post's dream of a winter White House came true with Trump's election in 2016. Trump regularly works out of the house he maintains at Mar-a-Lago and uses the club to host foreign dignitaries.\" One watchdog group, American Oversight, called for an investigation by the State Department inspector general and said it would request public records documenting how the blog post was created. The State Department describes the \"Share America\" site as its \"platform for sharing compelling stories and images that spark discussion and debate on important topics like democracy, freedom of expression, innovation, entrepreneurship, education, and the role of civil society.\" The site is produced by the department's Bureau of International Information Programs, which produces material distributed by U.S. embassies.",

            "body": "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos (Evan Vucci/AP) ' Education Secretary Betsy DeVos can't seem to make an accurate statement about the Common Core State Standards. The Core was among the most controversial topics in education for years. It started as a bipartisan effort to create a set of math and English language-arts standards for students across the country to use, but it became an educational and political mess. Most states adopted and implemented the standards early in the Obama administration - but failed to give teachers sufficient time to learn it, and critics from every part of the political spectrum found fault with some part of the initiative. A grass-roots revolt took place against the Core and federally funded standardized tests aligned to the standards, and some states have either replaced the standards or renamed them with minimal changes. When she was first nominated late last year to be education secretary by Donald Trump, the Michigan billionaire was described as a strong ally of former Florida governor - and Common Core booster - Jeb Bush. She had not at that time attacked the Core publicly but later said she was not a supporter. During the campaign, Trump had promised \"to get rid of Common Core,\" and at a December rally with the president-elect, she repeated that sentiment, saying that the Trump administration would put an \"end to the federal Common Core.\" [Was Louis C.K. right about the Common Core?] Here's the problem: The federal government didn't technically impose the Core on the individual states; the standards were fully or in part approved by state bodies, departments of education or legislatures in 46 states. Only states can decide to get rid of the standards, and, in fact, some have. The Obama administration did dangle federal funds before states as incentives to adopt the standards - an act some states saw as coercion - but states didn't have to adopt them, and a few didn't. Recently, DeVos told Michigan radio station host Frank Beckmann that the Every Student Succeeds Act effectively does away \"with the notion of the Common Core,\" Education Week reported. Wrong again. The ESSA, the successor law to No Child Left Behind, left it to states to decide on their standards, but, then again, the states had that right before. And many states are still using them. A recent analysis found that of the 46 states that adopted the standards, eight states have officially repealed or withdrawn, 21 states have finalized revisions - many of them minor - or have revision processes underway, and 17 states have not yet made any changes.  Then on Monday, Devos told Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer that the ESSA \"essentially does away with the whole argument about Common Core.\" Hemmer asked her whether she would withhold federal funds to states that decide to maintain the Common Core standards as part of their ESSA accountability plans, which must be submitted and approved by the Education Department. This was her response: There isn't really any Common Core any more. Each state is able to set the standards for their state. They may elect to adopt very high standards for their students to aspire to and to work toward. And that will be up to each state. Of course there still is something known as the Common Core. What she may have meant was that the federal government can't tell states what to do about the Core, though, again, it couldn't force states to adopt them before ESSA was passed in late 2015. So, the bottom line is that DeVos, yet again, has talked - incorrectly - about the Common Core. Here's more to read: [DeVos criticized Denver for its school choice policies.

            "body": "Kate O'Beirne came of age in the 1960s, amid the second wave of feminism, but in a characteristically pungent quip, the conservative commentator said she \"learned more about self-worth, ambition and opportunity from my conservative parents and Catholic nuns than I ever did from Eleanor Smeal and Gloria Steinem.\" Such luminaries of the women's movement were to be looked on with a gimlet eye, she said. Instead, she lionized the nun who coached the debate team at her all-girls' high school and \"encouraged us to go in for the kill\" against male opponents. The nun also urged her to go to law school. Mrs. O'Beirne, who died April 23 at 67, was a lawyer, an Army wife, a federal employee, a think-tank executive and a journalist. She rose to prominence in the 1990s as a columnist and editor with the conservative National Review magazine and as a TV pundit. She was a regular on public affairs shows including NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" CNN's \"The Capital Gang,\" MSNBC's \"Hardball\" and PBS's \"To the Contrary.\" She was in demand for her good-humored delivery, her policy wonk's passion for statistics and her skill at pithy, often provocative rejoinders on matters ranging from the role of women in combat (she was against it), school vouchers (she was for them) to welfare (symbolized, she said, by inner-city people \"living on a liberal plantation.\") She took aim at what she considered President Bill Clinton's legislative shortcomings as much as his persona as a sensitive modern man attuned to the pain of others. \"Women don't want a guy to feel their pain,\" she once said. \"They want a guy to clean the gutters.\" Kate O'Beirne on \"Meet the Press\" in 2007. (Alex Wong/Getty Images for Meet the Press) At times, she chided Republicans for emphasizing \"family values\" while at the same time producing presidential contenders with high divorce rates. \"Should Mitt Romney join a 2008 race that included John McCain, Rudy Giuliani [and] Newt Gingrich,\" she wryly observed in a National Review piece, \"the only guy in the GOP field with only one wife would be the Mormon.\" Jacob Heilbrunn, author of \"They Knew They Were Right: The Rise of the Neocons\" and editor of The National Interest magazine, said Mrs. O'Beirne was \"not a transformative figure\" in conservative thought as much as a \"traditional Catholic conservative who made quite a name for herself\" through her high visibility. She was named Washington editor of National Review in 1995 and spent 11 years in the job, writing about Congress, politics and domestic policy. The title of her column, \"Bread and Circuses,\" was a winking reference to the poet Juvenal and his satiric view of the citizens of ancient Rome desiring diversion over anything else. She arrived at the magazine at an important juncture. National Review, founded by William F. Buckley Jr. in 1955, long had a \"monopoly on conservative intellectual thought,\" Heilbrunn said. But the end of the Cold War, the Republican surge after the 1994 midterm elections and competition from the upstart Weekly Standard in 1995 forced National Review to reinvent itself. That meant, in part, seeking out a new breed of writer - less dour, more lively. With her \"feisty and humorous\" perspective, Heilbrunn said, Mrs. O'Beirne seemed an ideal fit. In addition to policy matters, cultural issues - including the legacy of feminism - became a defining concern of conservatives. To have a woman addressing those points helped usher Mrs. O'Beirne to the forefront of punditry in print, on television and on the dais. Kate O'Beirne (C) and journalist Judy Woodruff during a taping of \"Meet the Press\" at the NBC Studiosin Washington in 2007. (Alex Wong/Getty Images for Meet the Press) Kate Monica Walsh was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Sept. 23, 1949, and she grew up in Manhasset on Long Island. Her father was a partner in the venerable Manhattan nightclub Jimmy Ryan's, which focused on traditional instead of progressive jazz. Her mother was a homemaker who raised four daughters - Kate was the second - in an Irish-Catholic Republican home known for its animated dinner-table discussions. She was studying English and journalism at Good Counsel College, a Catholic women's school in White Plains, N.Y., when she left to work on James Buckley's successful 1970 Senate campaign on the Conservative Party of New York ticket. She completed her degree the next year, then worked in Washington as an aide to Buckley, the older brother of the National Review founder. She graduated in 1976 from St. John's University law school in Queens, N.Y. She briefly practiced law at the Interior Department, then accompanied her husband - an Army officer - on his military assignments until settling in the Washington area in 1985. After two years as deputy assistant secretary for legislative affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services, she joined the conservative Heritage Foundation policy-research organization in 1988, working on domestic-policy studies. She rose to vice president for government relations at the think tank when she began contributing to National Review. After ending her run as Washington editor of the magazine, she spent six years as president of the National Review Institute, a nonprofit that organizes conferences and hosts fellowships. She was described as a mentor to many young women in the conservative movement. Survivors include her husband, retired Army Lt. Col. James O'Beirne, and their two sons, Philip O'Beirne and John O'Beirne, all of McLean, Va.; three sisters, Mary Ann Rowan of Severna Park, Md., Virginia Rowell of Potomac Falls, Va., and Rosemary Walsh of McLean; and four grandchildren. The family confirmed the death and said the cause was cancer. Mrs. O'Beirne died at a hospital in Washington. She had caused a stir in 2006 with her book \"Women Who Make the World Worse: And How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Families, Military, Schools, and Sports.\" The book's premise was in keeping with her view that women were disserved by liberal lawmakers, feminists with a \"grievance agenda\" and others seeking - in her view - to reengineer society based on their \"antipathy to marriage and motherhood\" and their belief that \"there are no innate differences between men and women.\" In a C-SPAN interview, Mrs. O'Beirne said she did not take issue with \"consensus goals\" such as addressing sex discrimination in wages and employment, which she said had been achieved at the federal level decades earlier. \"Life was certainly simpler when we didn't have these opportunities,\" she said, \"but who would want to go back and not have the kind of choices we have? In other respects, I don't think women are necessarily better off. I think our culture, though more feminized, is coarser. I think traditional manners and mores and male chivalry did a better job of protecting women than litigation over girlie calendars.\" Read more Washington Post obituaries",

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) Student groups have filed a lawsuit against the University of California at Berkeley, saying school officials violated their right to free speech when they canceled a talk by a controversial speaker last week over security concerns. [How Berkeley has become the far left and far right's battleground] The lawsuit, filed by a prominent Republican lawyer, Harmeet Dhillon, on behalf of Berkeley College Republicans and Young America's Foundation, a national group fighting First Amendment issues on many campuses, charges that the university's actions smother the speech of conservative students whose opinions are a minority at Berkeley. Berkeley has become a flash point in the national debate over free speech, with clashes between the far left and the far right flaring into violence this year. The prestigious public university, where the campus free speech movement was born decades ago, has in recent months become a magnet for protesters and masked agitators who have fought, set fires and tossed explosives. [Trump lashes back after violent protests block speech by Breitbart writer Milo Yiannopoulos] In February, President Trump raised the threat of pulling federal funds from the public school after university police put the campus on lockdown and canceled a talk by another controversial figure, Milo Yiannopoulos, amid intense protests. Here's a look at some of the protests in the Berkeley, Calif., area in recent months. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) Berkeley College Republicans invited conservative commentator Ann Coulter to speak on campus Thursday, but university officials canceled the event because of concerns that they could not ensure student safety. They then invited her to speak next week instead at a safer location. Coulter is not a plaintiff, but on social media she called it \"our lawsuit\" and said they had asked for a safe venue for her speech \"THIS THURSDAY.\" The lawsuit contends, \"Though UC Berkeley promises its students an environment that promotes free debate and the free exchange of ideas, it had breached this promise through the repressive actions of University administrators and campus police, who have systematically and intentionally suppressed constitutionally-protected expression\" by the students who invited Coulter and the many students whose political views align with the plaintiffs, \"simply because that expression may anger or offend students, UC Berkeley administrators\" and community members who disagree. The lawsuit, which requests unspecified damages, attorney fees and a jury trial, names four university leaders, including University of California President Janet Napolitano and Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks, and three campus police officials as defendants. Dianne Klein, a spokeswoman for the University of California, sent a statement in response to the suit: \"The University of California welcomes speakers of all political viewpoints and is committed to providing a forum to enable Ann Coulter to speak on the Berkeley campus. \"The allegation contained in the complaint filed by Young America's Foundation that Ms. Coulter is being prohibited from speaking because of her conservative views is untrue. As the complaint itself notes, Young America's Foundation has sponsored many other speaking events at UC Berkeley in past years, including that of conservative political commentator and author Ben Shapiro, and the organization's efforts have led many notable conservatives to share their viewpoints with students and the public on campus. \"UC Berkeley has been working to accommodate a mutually agreeable time for Ms. Coulter's visit - which has not yet been scheduled  - and remains committed to doing so. The campus seeks to ensure that all members of the Berkeley and larger community - including Ms. Coulter herself - remain safe during such an event.\" The College Republicans did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit Monday. \"It used to be that universities were the beacon of intellectual thought and debate,\" Cliff Maloney Jr., president of Young Americans for Liberty, wrote in an email Monday. \"It is a shame that administrative agendas and regulations have stifled open and honest discourse. \"... All speech, whether popular or not, must be protected and we encourage students to challenge their public universities by demanding constitutional policies and practices.\" undefined Read the complaint here:   Staff writer William Wan contributed to this report.",

            "body": "Serena Williams has not played since winning the Australian Open in January. (Scott Barbour/Getty Images) Serena Williams had confirmed last week through a spokesman that she is pregnant, but Monday brought her first direct comments on the happy news. The 35-year-old posted a love letter to her unborn child on social media, one in which she celebrated some other happy news: her return to No. 1. [Williams is the latest in line of women to compete - and win - while pregnant] That stay will be brief, as Williams, who gained the No. 1 ranking when she won the Australian Open in January, has not played since then and, in the wake of her pregnancy, will take the rest of the season off. Since that triumph, in which Williams earned her 23rd Grand Slam singes title, a record for men and women in the Open era, she slipped to No. 2 behind Germany's Angelique Kerber, but a quirk in the WTA schedule pushed her back up. With Williams idle, Kerber will regain the top spot as soon as she wins a couple more matches, but in the meantime, Williams was \"so happy to share being number one in the world\" with her unborn child. She also confirmed that she will return to competition after giving birth, writing, \"I can't wait for you to join the players box next year.\" \"My Dearest Baby, You gave me the strength I didn't know I had,\" Williams wrote. \"You taught me the true meaning of serenity and peace. I can't wait to meet you. . . . From the world's oldest number one to the world's youngest number one. - Your Mommy.\" My Dearest Baby, You gave me the strength I didn't know I had. You taught me the true meaning of serenity and peace. I can't wait to meet you. I can't wait for you to join the players box next year. But most importantly, I am so happy to share being number one in the world with you.... once again today. On @alexisohanian bday. \ud83d\ude09 from the world's oldest number one to the world's youngest number one. -Your Mommy A post shared by Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) on Apr 24, 2017 at 6:06am PDT Williams became the oldest women to reach No. 1 in the WTA rankings in 2011, when she was 31. She first hit the top spot in July 2002, and she has held that position a total of 317 weeks, behind only Steffi Graf (377) and Martina Navratilova (332). Williams also gave a shout-out to her fiance, Internet entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian, who turned 33 on Monday. In turn, he shared his own social media post that celebrated the fact that she \"announced officially\" her pregnancy earlier in the day. A new Snoo is on the way! My number one, @serenawilliams, is pregnant (she announced officially earlier today) and I'm so excited to meet the little one. You keep amazing me. April 24 is a hard day for all of us Armenians; may we always remember the sacrifices our predecessors made; honor them through our successes; and appreciate our blessings. A post shared by Alexis Ohanian \ud83d\uddfd (@alexisohanian) on Apr 24, 2017 at 8:30am PDT Williams had apparently announced her pregnancy in an inadvertent way last week, posting an image to her Snapchat account that showed her with a bit of a belly and included the caption, \"20 weeks.\" She subsequently deleted the post, but the news had gotten out, and her caption indicated that she had been pregnant when she won the Australian Open. Later on Monday, Williams posted a note to social media in which she excoriated Romanian Fed Cup captain and former tennis star Ilie Nastase for making \"such racist comments toward myself and unborn child, and sexist comments against my peers.\" Of William's child, Nastase had reportedly said, \"Let's see what color it has. Chocolate with milk?\" \"This or anything else will not stop me from pouring love, light and positivity into everything that I do,\" Williams wrote. This will be the first child for both Williams and Ohanian, whose relationship dates back to at least October 2015, and who became engaged in December 2016.",

            "body": "Here's where things stand heading into Day 96 of the Trump administration: President Trump is getting closer to his 100th day in office, and without a major legislative achievement, he has his eye on this week's tax and tariff announcements as a way to show progress for his agenda. Trump plans to unveil principles for restructuring the tax code Wednesday, laying down a marker ahead of what is expected to be a long and complex process in Congress. On Monday, the Trump administration also said it plans to impose a 20 percent tariff on Canadian softwood lumber, in what could become the biggest trade dispute between the United States and Canada in more than a decade. Trump speaks to ambassadors at the White House on Monday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) The U.S. corporate tax rate is another target for the administration. White House officials are indicating that Trump plans to stick by his campaign pledge to cut that rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, a larger cut than House Republicans had proposed. This will be part of Trump's announcement Wednesday. TRUMP'S OTHER METRIC FOR SUCCESS? TV RATINGS. As the 100-day mark approaches, television ratings are also on the president's mind. Trump was a reality-show host and cable-news commentator long before he was a political candidate, and the way television has influenced his thinking and approach to public office is becoming more apparent the longer he is in office. President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) Take this comment from a working lunch at the White House last month. One attendee, wondering about job security in Trump's administration, asked whether White House press secretary Sean Spicer might be the first top aide to depart. \"I'm not firing Sean Spicer,\" Trump said in response, our colleagues reported. \"That guy gets great ratings. Everyone tunes in.\" Not all of Trump's comments about ratings are so benign. The president is receiving criticism for telling the Associated Press, in an interview published Sunday, that his presence on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" pushed its viewership to its highest level \"since the World Trade Center came down.\" \"It's the highest for 'Face the Nation,' or as I call it, 'Deface the Nation,'\" Trump said. \"It's the highest for 'Deface the Nation' since the World Trade Center. ... It's a tremendous advantage.\" THE LATEST ON THE SHUTDOWN WATCH Congress is back in town this week with one major task: avoiding a government shutdown late Friday, when current funds run out. Trump might or might not make this more difficult. Since the weekend, Trump has hammered away on Twitter at the need for the next funding package to include money for a wall along the southern U.S. border. Democrats, whose votes are necessary to approve a funding bill in the Senate, have said they will not agree to this. ....the wall is not built, which it will be, the drug situation will NEVER be fixed the way it should be!#BuildTheWall - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 24, 2017 The stalemate seemed to hold for much of Monday, at least publicly, with Trump continuing to tweet about the need to fund the wall. But White House officials signaled at the same time that the president might be open to a bill that would fund border security measures but not an actual wall. Trump has also opened the door to getting the wall funding this fall instead of this week, a White House official confirmed to our colleague. Negotiations are continuing as the clock ticks down toward Friday night. STATE DEPARTMENT WEBSITE FEATURES MAR-A-LAGO Trump's private club in Palm Beach has come to symbolize the range of potential conflicts of interest he faces at the White House. That's because Mar-a-Lago isn't just a private estate where Trump spends his weekends. It's a part of his business empire, a place where private individuals pay hefty membership fees for the privilege of rubbing shoulders with the president, administration officials and foreign dignitaries. Depending on the night, members might even watch Trump formulate a national-security response in real time, as took place in mid-February. President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Fla. (Yuri Gripas/Reuters) This already makes Trump critics uncomfortable. So it's no wonder there was an outcry Monday as watchdog groups circulated a federal website that recently featured Mar-a-Lago in a travelogue-style blog piece. The website, which is affiliated with the State Department, promotes travel to the United States. Its choice to feature Mar-a-Lago raises the question: Is the federal government improperly promoting Trump's businesses? The website took down the post late Monday and replaced it with a message that sought to address concerns. \"The intention of the article was to inform the public about where the President has been hosting world leaders. We regret any misperception,\" the message stated. Follow the author: @eliseviebeck.",

            "body": "ATLANTA - While three members of the Atlanta Hawks enjoyed the postgame spotlight, the Washington Wizards' two biggest stars waited. Late Monday night, John Wall and Bradley Beal stood in the back of the Hawks' practice facility, a black curtain separating the silence on their end from the mirth passed along the podium among Dwight Howard, Jose Calderon and Kent Bazemore. Wall and Beal had to yield the floor to the victors, but earlier the Wizards had surrendered even more - losing control of this first-round series after Atlanta won, 111-101. The series is tied at two games apiece with a must-win Game 5 - as one Wizards player described it - looming Wednesday night at Verizon Center. \"We're 2-2 right now. We move on. We have home court right now,\" Beal said, standing on one of the few things the Wizards still can have confidence in. \"So we're going to protect our house and come back here more focused for Game 6.\" Coming from Beal's lips, the plan seems simple. Through two games on the road, however, the Wizards made the series much more difficult as their defense regressed and frustrations with fouls heightened. [Jerry Brewer: Struggles were inevitable for Wizards, and they arrived in Atlanta.] On Monday, Atlanta scored 44 points in the paint while Howard (16 points and 15 rebounds) awakened from his series slumber by slamming home lobs. Even when Howard went quiet in the fourth quarter, the Wizards' fragile defense still couldn't contain the Hawks. The teams entered the final quarter tied at 77, but Washington bowed to the whims of Atlanta's offense and allowed 34 points. While Beal (11 for 23 for 32 points) and Wall (22 points and 10 assists) finally had a strong game together, the Hawks countered that with all five of their starters scoring in double figures. Even bench players Bazemore and Calderon combined for 26 points and 12 assists. Markieff Morris, who called Hawks all-star Paul Millsap a \"crybaby,\" entered the game as the villain at Philips Arena. Morris did not back up his talk, however, partly because he was limited by foul trouble. Morris finished with nine points (3-for-10 shooting), three rebounds and five fouls. \"Since that [first] game, he's been in some foul trouble,\" Coach Scott Brooks said. \"The stats say he hasn't shot the ball well, but he hasn't had a rhythm. He's been in foul trouble ever since that Game 1. But that's part of it. You've got to play through it. He picked up two, and he picked up four real quick. And he got the fifth one. He'll bounce back. I've got confidence in him, how he plays, how he plays for us. I expect him to have a better game in a couple of nights.\" [Best and worst from Wizards' Game 4 loss to Hawks] The Wizards could have scripted the start. In the opening quarter, they shot 55.7 percent from the field, and even better, their defense was given a break when Dennis Schroder headed to the Hawks' bench. Wall aggressively drew three fouls on Schroder, and in doing so he eliminated the Hawks' best playmaker. For the rest of the first half, the Wizards did not have to worry about chasing the streak of blond down the lane (Schroder rocks a funky flaxen dye job in his hair) or concern themselves by over-helping against his replacement, the 35-year-old Calderon. Finally, foul trouble favored the Wizards, and they started the quarter with a clear advantage - not only the 35-28 score but also with Schroder glued to the bench - but mishandled the opportunity. At the 10:22 mark, Bojan Bogdanovic wisely posted up the smaller Calderon and scored while being fouled. After the three-point play, though, the Wizards' offense went dark for nearly five minutes. Instead of attacking the slow-footed Calderon, who played with three fouls, the Wizards settled for more jumpers - missing 15 of 20 shots, with only three of those attempts coming inside the paint. Even more troubling, Washington grew exceptionally sloppy with the ball and committed eight turnovers. Conversely, the Hawks worked the inside game. Rookie Taurean Prince, who made 4 of 4 shots and scored nine points in the first half, demonstrated how aggression is rewarded in the playoffs. With 3:10 remaining in the half, Prince made a quick first step to the rim, and, though Morris gave little contact in resistance, the first-year player was given the foul as he hit the layup. \"We made a lot of defensive mistakes,\" Brooks summed up. \"We took a lot of tough shots.\" Early in the fourth quarter, the Hawks still operated with authority as they opened an 89-81 lead and forced several Wizards starters back onto the floor. Though the wholesale changes sparked Washington - Morris hit a shot clock-beating jumper, Bogdanovic spaced out for a three, and Wall raced inside for a layup for seven straight points - Atlanta stopped the run and buried the Wizards with one of its own. Later, Wall and Beal waited behind the curtain like understudies. The voices of the three featured Hawks amplified through the facility - with Howard trying to crack jokes and Calderon answering questions in Spanish. The duo waited their turn, as well as a chance to redeem Washington in this series.",

Somehow, Jimenez has managed to remain undefeated through four starts, even though he has only pitched well in one of them. Of course, he's not exactly 4-0, but the Orioles have still won all of his starts after pounding three home runs off Tampa Bay ace Chris Archer on the way to a soggy 6-3 victory over the Rays before an announced 11,142 at Camden Yards. The Rays jumped out to an instant lead when leadoff man Corey Dickerson homered. After the Orioles tied the game in the third, Tampa Bay increased its lead to two when Jimenez spun out of control in the fourth and bunched four walks around a two-run double by outfielder Shane Peterson. To that point, Archer was very much in control. He allowed just one run on two hits through five innings and got the first two outs in the sixth before the Orioles started to flex their muscle. Hyun Soo Kim drove a towering fly ball to center for his first home run. Jonathan Schoop followed moments later with his fifth of the year to tie the game. The decisive swing came from Adam Jones, who had three hits in the game and delivered his 1,500th career hit in his previous at-bat. He scalded a two-run shot into the left-field bleachers in the seventh inning - his fourth homer of the season. - Baltimore Sun",

            "body": "Jabrill Peppers's 2016 season for Michigan earned him numerous awards and unanimous all-American status. (Charlie Neibergall/Associated Press) Jabrill Peppers is expected to be a first-round pick in the NFL draft, which starts Thursday. At least, Peppers was thought to go that early, but Monday brought a double-shot of bad news that may result in some NFL teams passing on the Michigan star. First, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that Peppers was flagged for a diluted urine sample, after he took his drug test during the NFL combine. That is tantamount to a failed drug test, and it could have some teams questioning his maturity and decision-making, if not his off-field proclivities. [The NFL draft's fastest rising QB chose football and its risks over baseball and a guaranteed $1.6 million] \"Peppers went to the combine. He was sick after flying there from San Diego. He has a history of cramping,\" a spokesman for Creative Artists Agency, which represents Peppers, told Schefter. \"Peppers was being pumped with fluids, drinking eight to 10 bottles of water before he went to bed, because he was the first guy to work out two days for the [linebackers] and [defensive backs]. He had to go through that first day, come back on second day, and that was the fear. \"So Peppers was pounding water and under the weather. He never failed a drug test in his life, nor tested positive before for any substance.\" Text from front office executive on Jabrill Peppers and diluted sample: \"Does he think we're stupid?\" - mike freeman (@mikefreemanNFL) April 24, 2017 Schefter, who probably shouldn't expect a Christmas card from Peppers, subsequently reported (via Pro Football Talk) that some NFL teams were already dinging the versatile athlete for sitting out the Wolverines' bowl game, a 33-32 loss to Florida State in December's Orange Bowl. Schefter had reported at the time that Peppers tried to practice with a hamstring strain but ultimately decided, shortly before the game began, that the injury was too severe. Other college standouts, such as Stanford running back Christian McCaffrey and LSU's Leonard Fournette, also skipped their teams' respective bowl games, but they had announced their intentions to do so well ahead of time. According to Schefter, some NFL executives don't like that Peppers's decision came at the last moment, and they have downgraded him on their draft boards. Add it up, and Peppers could be waiting to hear his name called much longer than he thought he would. Teams, always on the lookout for what they perceive to be character flaws, will have to weigh Monday's reports against his considerable talent. A New Jersey native, Peppers went to Michigan out of admiration for former Wolverines star Charles Woodson, and he nearly equaled the latter's achievement of becoming the only primarily defensive player to win the Heisman Trophy. A linebacker and safety for the Wolverines, plus an occasional running back, Peppers also excelled as a kick returner, and he promises to provide unusual playmaking ability as a professional. Not Breaking News @JabrillPeppers HAD a diluted sample, But Did Not test POSITIVE for anythingBig difference - Charles Woodson (@cwoodson24) April 24, 2017 [The most likely draft picks to be traded and teams who could make a deal] Despite the diluted sample, ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper said Monday (via MLive.com), \"I'd be surprised if he got out of the first round.\" Alabama linebacker Reuben Foster, who was sent home from the combine after getting into a physical altercation with a medical staffer, failed his drug test in the same manner, and he is still widely expected to be a first-round pick. \"You have to look at it, and every team is going to evaluate it,\" Kiper said of Peppers. \"You hear what his side says about what the reason was that happened - you've heard the same thing from Foster's camp. You've got to look at it and evaluate it, and I think they made the point he's never had any issues before.\" Kiper said that teams picking in the top 10 may well have eliminated Peppers from consideration for those selections, but he added, \"I'm sure there's some teams in the late first round that didn't think they'd see him there that may see him still on the board at that point.\" Joe Thomas, an all-pro offensive tackle for the Browns who played college ball at Wisconsin, posted a number of tweets Monday arguing that players who test positive for a diluted sample should be tested again until they provide a sample that can properly be tested for evidence of drug use. \"Tester should be able to see it's dilute right when he receives sample and can then request more samples until it's not dilute,\" Thomas said on Twitter. \"No player should ever have a 'failed test' for a dilute sample. Especially at the combine where players frequently chug water to gain weight,\" Thomas continued. He noted that players could be \"chugging water to hydrate for a day of grueling physical testing. Lack of hydration leads to a significant decrease in performance.\" Foster reportedly told teams that his diluted sample was the result of a frantic attempt to counteract dehydration before the combine after he came down with what he thought was food poisoning. Peppers and Foster are set to begin their NFL careers in the league's drug program; they will be discharged after 180 days if they cooperate with guidelines and have no further violations in that time.",

            "body": "ATLANTA - For the past two months, the Washington Wizards have been a trendy pick to do well in the NBA playoffs. Since that epic overtime tussle with Cleveland in early February, dreams of a Wizards-Cavaliers Eastern Conference finals have danced in heads in the District and far beyond. Never mind that the Wizards haven't made such a run in nearly 40 years. This team is fun and rising fast and has had some previous playoff success, and the NBA can be so mundane because the best teams die slowly, so why not promote an upstart? There's only one problem with that level of hype and hope: The Wizards still don't really know how to handle prosperity. And so, if you saw a clear path for the Wizards in the East, you must have a powerful imagination. This may indeed be Washington's year to go far, but struggle was inevitable. And struggle arrived Monday night at Philips Arena. You know that first-round series that the Wizards threatened to end quickly after winning the first two games over Atlanta at Verizon Center? Well, they just went on the road and allowed the Hawks to even the series. In Game 4, Atlanta tied it with a 111-101 victory at Philips Arena despite being required to do the improbable. To keep the Wizards from taking a commanding three games to one lead, the Hawks needed 26 points and 12 assists from the reserve duo of 35-year-old Jose Calderon and Kent Bazemore, who is known more for the $70 million contract he can't live up to these days. If you had told any sane person before the game that Calderon and Bazemore would need that kind of production to keep the Wizards from winning, the logical reaction would have been to start collecting restaurant recommendations in Chicago and Boston. Because the Wizards were about to go home and end the series, for sure. Instead, Bazemore contributed 16 points and seven assists, and Calderon had 10 points and five dimes. The Wizards were left frustrated by shaky defense and the inability to capitalize on a second quarter in which they should have pushed Atlanta to the brink. And now this will be a long series. I wouldn't say the Wizards are in trouble. Neither team has lost at home, and Washington still has home-court advantage. But this is now a best-of-three fight instead of an easy road. The Wizards lost control of this game in the second quarter, at a time when it seemed they had a chance to take further advantage of the Hawks. Atlanta point guard Dennis Schroder, who averaged 25 points in the first three games of the series, committed three fouls trying to defend John Wall and had to sit the final 15 minutes of the first half. Calderon, his backup, also had three fouls early in the second quarter, but he remained in the game. Washington should have seized the moment and extended the lead. The Hawks shot just 9 of 24 (37.5 percent) in the first quarter, and now they had a tricky situation at point guard. They stuck with Calderon over rookie Malcolm Delaney, which meant the 35-year-old had to manage an offense that is more dangerous with Schroder and play defense without fouling. And Calderon is a poor defender even when he can play aggressive. But Calderon played well, and the Wizards fell apart when they were positioned to prosper. Extend the lead? The Wizards lost it quickly as the bench performed poorly, especially on the defensive end. And when the starters returned, the Wizards allowed Calderon to get away with guarding Bradley Beal and didn't fully exploit the mismatch. Calderon, who had eight points and four assists in the first half, actually controlled the action despite the three fouls. Dwight Howard, who has been an offensive non-factor all series, started catching alley-oops, and he posted a double-double (14 points, 11 rebounds) by halftime. The Wizards continued to give up easy baskets to Atlanta rookie forward Taurean Prince, and Bazemore made open shots and helped Calderon with playmaking duties, registering five first-half assists. Atlanta outscored Washington 31-15 in the second quarter. That early advantage turned into a 59-50 halftime deficit. The Wizards went into halftime needing Markieff Morris, who was again in foul trouble and out of rhythm, to find his game. They needed their frontcourt to compete better against the Hawks, who owned the boards and nearly doubled the Wizards' points-in-the-paint output. For the third straight game, Morris was frustrated. A fan at Philips Arena held up a sign depicting Morris with tears falling down his cheeks and the words \"CRYBABY\" written at the top, a reference to Morris's accusation after Game 3 that Paul Millsap is a whiner. Even though Morris played just 10 minutes in the first half, the Wizards contained Millsap. In the first three games, Millsap was averaging 25 points and 8.7 rebounds. He was shooting 54.8 percent from the field and averaging 11.7 free throws. Before the game, I asked Wizards coach Scott Brooks what he wanted to take away from the Hawks star. \"First, I know why I voted for him as an all-star because this is what he is,\" Brooks said. \"He's a terrific basketball player. He just does his work. Anything we can eliminate, it's the free throws. Saying that, we've got to do a better job of not putting him on the line. He averages [5.9] through the year; he's averaging 11 through these three games. That's a big increase, double-digit amount of attempts. \"We have to do a better job at that, but he's good. He can score in so many areas of the floor. He has a great handle. You saw a couple times he's brought the ball up the court and made great decisions, whether it's for himself attacking the rim or finding an open shooter in the corner. That's what he does. Like I said, he's one of the better players in this league at that position.\" Millsap made only 2 of 7 shots early, but the Wizards still trailed. In every phase of the game, they were struggling and hindering their chances to take a 3-1 series lead. Entering the second quarter, the scenario was ideal for a road victory, but the Wizards were determined to take a more difficult route, as usual.

And struggle arrived Monday night at Philips Arena. You know that first-round series that the Wizards threatened to end quickly after winning the first two games over Atlanta at Verizon Center? Well, they just went on the road and deflated their cushion. The series is tied at two games apiece now, after the Hawks claimed a 111-101 victory despite being required to resurrect a fading point guard and turn an overpaid role player into a game-changing playmaker. [Wizards fall apart in fourth quarter of Game 4 loss to Hawks] To keep the Wizards from taking a commanding three games to one lead, the Hawks needed 26 points and 12 assists from the reserve duo of 35-year-old Jose Calderon and Kent Bazemore, a really nice kid who is known more for the $70 million contract he can't live up to these days. If you had told any sane person that Calderon and Bazemore would need that kind of production to keep the Wizards from winning, the logical reaction would have been to start collecting restaurant recommendations in Chicago and Boston. Because the Wizards were about to go home and end the series, for sure. Instead, Bazemore contributed 16 points and seven assists, transforming into Dwight Howard's designated lob thrower. And Calderon finished with 10 points and five dimes, and the Hawks outscored the Wizards by 29 points in the 20 minutes he played. When Bazemore and Calderon took the stage with Howard (16 points, 15 rebounds) for a postgame interview, it emphasized both a surprise that makes the postseason delightful and a reason for the Wizards to lament a blown opportunity. \"I always think I'm going to be on the podium,\" Calderon said, smiling. \"I think I'm onto something,\" Bazemore said of his alley-oop passing skills. And now this will be a long series. I wouldn't say the Wizards are in trouble. Neither team has lost at home, and Washington still has home-court advantage. But this is now a best-of-three fight instead of an easy road. The Wizards were left frustrated by shaky defense and the inability to capitalize on a second quarter in which they should have pushed Atlanta to the brink.

Calderon, his backup, also had three fouls early in the second quarter, but he remained in the game. [Best and worst from Wizards' Game 4 loss to Hawks] Washington should have seized the moment and extended the lead. Calderon is a poor defender even when he can be aggressive.

Calderon actually controlled the action despite the three fouls. Howard, who has been an offensive non-factor all series, posted a double-double by halftime. Atlanta outscored Washington 31-15 in the second quarter. A solid Wizards first quarter had turned into a 59-50 halftime deficit. \"We made a lot of defensive mistakes,\" Wizards Coach Scott Brooks said of the second quarter. \"We took a lot of tough shots.\" For the third straight game, Wizards power forward Markieff Morris was frustrated and in foul trouble. A fan held up a sign depicting Morris with tears falling down his cheeks and the words \"CRYBABY\" written at the top, a reference to Morris's accusation after Game 3 that Paul Millsap is a whiner. Morris played just 24 minutes and scored nine points on 3-for-10 shooting. \"The stats say he hasn't shot the ball well, but he hasn't had a rhythm,\" Brooks said. \"He's been in foul trouble ever since that Game 1. But that's part of it. You've got to play through it. He picked up two [fouls], and he picked up four real quick. And he got the fifth one. He'll bounce back. I've got confidence in him, how he plays, how he plays for us. I expect him to have a better game in a couple of nights.\" Even though Morris played just 10 minutes in the first half, the Wizards contained Millsap. He finished with 19 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, but Millsap made only 2 of 7 shots early. The Wizards still trailed. In every phase of the game, they were struggling and hindering their chances to take a 3-1 series lead. The Wizards would recover and play a good third quarter, but then they allowed Atlanta to score 34 points in the final period and tie the series. They lost the game in those even quarters, by failing to take command in the second and by failing to close at the end. \"It was just too up and down,\" said Beal, who led all scorers with 32 points. \"You spend all your time and energy trying to play catch-up, and then you can't finish in the fourth quarter.\" Said Brooks: \"Basically, what I see is two very good basketball teams, evenly matched, fighting for their playoff lives. We're the fourth and fifth seed. The series is tied. It's basically the first to two now.\" The game presented a scenario ideal for a road victory, but the Wizards were determined to take a more difficult route, as usual.

            "body": "A five-alarm fire swept through an apartment house being built in Prince George's County Monday, causing an estimated $39 milion in damage and saturating part of College Park with so much smoke that a nearby apartment with many seniors was evacuated and the University of Maryland closed. The fire brought a historic response for the county and involved more than 200 firefighters from across the region who began arriving about 10:30 a.m., while other units backfilled for routine calls as more alarms went out, according to acting county fire chief Benjamin M. Barksdale. The cause was under investigation, officials said. The smoke lingered into early evening as the investigation continued in the 4700 block of Berwyn- House Road in College Park, where the fire broke out on the fifth and sixth floors of a nearly completed seven-story building named Fuse 47. Its sprinkler systems were not yet in service, according to fire officials. Two firefighters suffered minor injuries, Barksdale said. Mabel Thomas, 75, was one of about 40 residents of Spellman House, across the street from the fire, who was moved to the community room of a nearby apartment house. She said she had smelled smoke and gone to her window, but saw only gray outside. (Mark Brady) \"It looked like living in a foggy city,\" she said. As smoke detectors inside her building went off, she packed her purse with medication for 76-year-old Emmanuel Greene, a neighbor she takes care of. She and Greene waited for several hours for the all-clear in the community room, where people were gathered at card tables and provided with pizza. \"We're just waiting,\" Greene said. \"That's all we can do.\" Spellman House residents were allowed home about 7 p.m. A partial roof collapse and the building's \"doughnut\" shape - with four facades surrounding a courtyard - made it difficult to get water on the blaze, and fire authorities said they worried about a possible collapse. At one point, a county helicopter sent video to fire commanders to help direct the push to tamp the blaze, Barksdale said. \"There is a lot of wood in this building,\" Barksdale said, adding that empty spaces in the building made it easy for fire to travel. Stacey Carter, 31, who lives in a townhouse across the street from the construction site, also was waiting for the all-clear in the community room. She said she dropped off her 7-year-old son, Jason, at school and returned home as firefighters converged on her street. She stayed inside for about 30 minutes with her 2-year-old daughter, Savannah, until the smoke became intolerable. \"I had to leave because the smoke was so bad,\" she said, worried about returning home because her son and her 62-year-old mother have asthma. University of Maryland President Wallace D. Loh said he was closing the school's campus at 1 p.m., citing \"poor air quality.\" Barksdale said people living or working near the fire \"should be okay\" if they turn off heating and cooling systems to avoid the smoke, which was kept near the ground by clouds. County Fire Department spokesman Mark E. Brady said the blaze led to the largest fire suppression effort in county history. In addition, he said Monday in a blog post, the $39 million loss estimate was among the largest for a fire in the county. Fire personnel would be at the scene through Monday night and into Tuesday morning, Brady said. He said the building was to have about 250 apartments, stores and a parking garage, and was scheduled for for occupancy in July 2017. Meanwhile, a drone flew into the area of the fire, forcing the police helicopter to take evasive action, police said. They said Trevon Miller, 24, of Baltimore Avenue in College Park was arrested and charged with interfering with police and fire response. Dana Hedgpeth and Martin Weil contributed to this report.

            "body": "Adapted from a recent online discussion. Dear Carolyn: My mom is a bipolar narcissist - the bipolar part diagnosed clinically, the narcissist part by own assessment. She is estranged from me, my sister and my dad, her ex-husband. Unlike my dad and sister, I never foreclosed on the possibility of reconnecting. She has been unpredictable and emotionally abusive at various points, and enough was enough. However, she also has the capacity to be loving, generous and kind - and I am grateful for those times that she was a good mom. I just proposed to my boyfriend. There is no wedding date set yet, but I want to consider having my mom there. It will be thorny, to say the least, with my dad and sister in attendance - and I can't be assured that she won't behave poorly. But my gut tells me that I would feel a tremendous loss without her presence. I am on the fence about inviting her, as it would also mean reestablishing contact and potentially reopening a lot of wounds and relationship conflicts. I also fear that her presence may create more family stress. I cannot decide how to proceed. What are your thoughts? (Nick Galifianakis/for The Washington Post) - Never Foreclosed Never Foreclosed: In my head, I am hearing the red-alert sound from the Enterprise. (The original, because I'm old.) Since \"it would also mean reestablishing contact,\" why peg it to your wedding day? Why don't you reestablish contact for the sake of it, and then make up your mind? Or, probably closer to the truth, let her make up your mind. Dear Carolyn: This might be the oldest question in the book, but here it goes. My boyfriend and I broke up this week. We both love each other, but he wanted to move in and get married and I'm not quite there yet, so we came to a mutual agreement that parting ways was the right decision. I'd still be up for being the best friends we were before we started dating. He wanted no contact because he said talking, emailing or texting, even at a reduced level, would be too painful. Of course, I agreed to his wishes. Is there ever a point where I can check in with him to see what he's up to? We were the best of friends before we ruined everything by falling in love. I miss having him in my life, and I'm genuinely curious about how life is going for him. I don't want to be disrespectful or make things harder by checking in, and I would only do it some predetermined time from now (six months?), but I don't know if it's a good idea at all. - Contacting the Ex? Contacting the Ex?: I think you have to leave him alone unless and until you change your mind about marrying him. Being \"genuinely curious\" is not enough - especially since it's about you, not him. Re: Contacting the Ex: It sounds like the letter-writer is asking, \"Does 'no contact' really mean 'no contact'?\" And yes, yes it does. - Anonymous Anonymous: Right, thanks. No loopholes here.

            "body": "Dear Miss Manners: Since my husband and I both retired, I am noticing some etiquette situations with friends and acquaintances that are awkward and annoying. I am always taken aback and don't know quite how to respond to these various questions: 1. If I say that I am not up to doing something, and someone asks, \"How come?'' 2. When something needs doing at home and I happen to mention it, and the response is, \"Why can't your husband do it?'' 3. \"Have you had a colonoscopy yet?'' 4. \"When are you going to downsize?'' 5. \"You need to rent a place in the South for the winter.'' 6. \"You and your husband need to get out more.'' 7. \"How many medications are you on?'' 8. \"You shouldn't be eating that.'' 9. \"When are you going to get around to doing such-and-such?'' 10. \"Have you purchased your burial plots yet?'' 11. \"Why doesn't your husband/wife like doing such-and-such anymore?'' 12. \"Why do you need that at your age?'' Thank you for any suggestions! Nice crowd you have there. Miss Manners is tempted to augment question 5 with the suggestion that you move south, or anywhere else, to get rid of them. One suggestion will do to respond to all of these: \"How kind you are to take such an interest in our business.'' Dear Miss Manners: Donation containers for the needy by our cash registers have been relabeled for tips. I felt that was tacky, but since it didn't require any action on my part, I sought to ignore it. Now credit card payments flag the customer screen with a yes/no question: \"Would you like to leave a tip?'' It then flags me that my customer (if they choose to do so) is leaving a tip ... to which I am to give a certain response. I feel this whole tip thing is tacky and rather rude. If I am going to receive a tip, I don't think I should be informed of it. I've seen many price increases, and to ask the customer to give yet more money seems wrong. What do you think? That more people should patronize the restaurants that have decided to abolish tipping. Miss Manners is puzzled that customers don't seem to understand that they pay no more when the cost of labor is built into the prices, and spare themselves possible embarrassment. Dear Miss Manners: When I invite a guest, sometimes before they accept my invitation they say they need to see what's going on that night. Should I rescind the offer so I can invite someone I know will come? I'm not sure I like the \"maybe, man'' attitude. I would either decline or accept. There should be no middle ground. Am I wrong? Your response should be, \"Well, perhaps another time.'' However, Miss Manners does not recommend that you name another time - ever. Why would you want to entertain someone who so clearly hopes that something better will come along? New Miss Manners columns are posted Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays on washingtonpost.com/advice.

            "body": "Dear Amy: My wife and I love the beach. We walk on the beach, kayak, picnic and in the summer we swim. When it's hot and the beach is crowded, my wife invariably asks me, \"Are you checking out that girl in the bikini?\" I always say, \"No,\" which is a lie she sees right through. An argument ensues, dampening our otherwise beautiful day. I am in my 50s. I have no delusions of long-term futures with young girls (or anyone else) on the beach, but I love to look at attractive females. I try, apparently unsuccessfully, to be discreet, but my natural instinct is to stand and applaud. I know I sound like a dirty old man, but I doubt I am alone. So, how can I be honest and not hurt my wife? And can we still go to the beach? Lying on the Beach Lying on the Beach: I think many of us in middle age passively admire young and beautiful people without being lascivious (your wife might actually be in this category, but from your own description, you are not). And so no - I won't help you to find a way to check out women in front of your wife. You say you know you sound like a dirty old man, and you're right; you do. In fact, I read this letter to one of my daughters, who rolled her eyes and said, \"Ugh, gross.\" I doubt that was the reaction you were going for. All \"attractive females\" know when they're being checked out. Some may enjoy the attention, but even if they do, the last thing they want on their day at the beach is a round of applause from you. In this context, your wife's feelings are more important than theirs - or yours - because she is the one you're married to. She is (presumably) the woman you're going home with. You have a choice here: Either stop checking out women, or come clean when she catches you and risk an argument. The first choice will make your beautiful beach days continue for many years; the second one will probably lead to her turning these beach trips into solo expeditions. Stop blaming your wife for being frustrated about your inability to keep your eyes in your head. Dear Amy: After nearly 15 years of marriage, my wife and I have yet to agree on the cleaning of dishes. I was taught growing up that dishes are not to be left in the sink. My wife grew up in a family that left everything in the sink until, I suppose, someone had time to clean up. If I don't touch the dishes she's left in the sink, she will clean them up within a few hours. The problem is that she gets mad at me whenever I'm washing one of my own dishes and I ignore hers. I don't mind cleaning other peoples' dishes now and then (and we have young kids, which complicates the problem). But I resent being expected to clean her dishes nearly every time I go to the sink, while she is never left to clean mine. Any thoughts? Feeling Dished Feeling Dished: You are facing an all-too-common domestic question. One obvious solution is that if you want the dishes washed - now - then you should wash them. All of them. I think you know it's obnoxiously passive-aggressive to do only your own. You two are married parents, not Craigslist roommates. You should each step up and do things that need to be done without keeping score. In my household, whoever cooks doesn't have to do the dishes. It's a pretty simple equation. Getting them washed before breakfast the next day seems like a reasonable goal. I'm sure there are things you do (or don't do) around the house that drive your wife crazy, too, so maybe it's time to revisit the distribution of labor. Also, get your children involved. The kids in my life love having jobs; I have a photo of my 5-year-old nieces loading the dishwasher with such precision and glee, you'd think they were on a trip to Disneyland. I'd love to hear from other readers here. How do you settle household-chore debates? Dear Amy: The letter from \"Disturbed Dad\" literally made me sick. This dad was trying to teach his young children that stepfamilies aren't \"real\" relatives. Thank you for reeducating him. Grateful for My Steps Grateful for My Steps: Many readers responded as you have. Thank you. \u00a9 2017 by Amy Dickinson distributed by Tribune Content Agency",

                "Either your wife wants an argument when she asks you or you are doing it so blatantly that she is embarrassed for the both of you. I've betting on the latter. I think your stance on 'standing and applauding 'is rather creepy but every guy at a beach is looking at women at some point. They've just mastered the art of not being the guy whose head literally goes from left to right as a woman walks by.",

                "Baggy shorts, too, if he's standing up and applauding.", 
                "LW2) Keeping track in a marriage is never a good thing.  One of the deacons at my church told me during marital preparation that marriage is never 50/50.  One of us will always be giving more. You might want to consider that you will contribute more to dishes and think about other areas where your wife contributes more.  If you cannot do that, I wonder how long your marriage can last with you trying to keep things \"fair\" and balanced.", 
                "LW1) Amy nailed it. You do sound like a dirty old man, and I bet you're not much to look at either which is usually the case with older men who are so obviously checking out younger women in a disgusting manner. \nWe can all appreciate beauty, but it sounds like you're going overboard. You should go to the beach by yourself and stare away on your own and not in the presence of your wife.", 
                "Ick no thanks, don't come to the beach by yourself either - even if they wife isn't there, you'll still be making the women feel uncomfortable and spoiling their days.  Just learn to not be so gross.  I check out hot men all the time but somehow manage to do it without anyone noticing.", 
                "LW2, you're seriously acting like such a child? \"I'll wash my dish, but not yours.\" Who washes the pots? Serving dishes? Maybe you only eat take-out.\n\nYou missed part of the lesson, or you had a very odd family. Did you all line up at the sink to wash your own plates? Wash 'em all or be quiet.", 
                "This is a LW that I'd love to hear back from after he gets divorced. He sounds so idiotic I hope it's a fake letter.", 
                "You know what's funny? The more idiotic they sound, the more real I think they are. This guy wrote this. I'm picturing him waiting for the day the baby is old enough to wash her own dish.",

            "body": "Dear Heloise: My part-time job at a retailer offers direct deposit into my checking account. The retailer also can deposit my pay onto a prepaid card. It's like a credit card, but if I need cash, I use an ATM, which charges me a fee. Please tell your readers to read the fine print! A Worker Bee in Dallas Worker Bee in Dallas: Thanks for the good information that I'm more than happy to pass along! Readers, a prepaid (payroll) card is like a debit or gift card. There is no bank account to withdraw from or even check your balance. An employer \"deposits\" or \"loads\" your wages onto the card. You can shop, pay bills, etc., like it's a regular credit card. However, when getting money from an ATM, you have to pay the ATM fee to get your money! So, if you need cash, take out more than you think you will use, so there is only a one-time fee. Dear Heloise: My complaint is people who throw their garbage in the trash can unwrapped. It stinks! As soon as the lid is lifted, the wind blows papers out, and as the men lift to dump the trash, corncobs, watermelon rinds and apple peels fall out - ugh! The smell from the trash cans is awful. I wrap my garbage in recycled bags. I feel for the trash pickup men who have to smell all that trash. A Reader in Boardman, Ohio Reader in Boardman, Ohio: You are right: The trash should be contained so it doesn't fly about, and corncobs, apple peels, etc., should go in the compost pile, if possible. Wet garbage can be put in a store plastic bag, tied and then put into the garbage can. Here's how I clean the big outdoor trash can: vinegar and dish soap! Put several cups of vinegar and a big squirt of dishwashing soap in the trash can, fill with water about one-third of the way and scrub with a broom. Dump out, rinse and let the can dry in the sun. Vinegar is handy for so many uses around the house, and it is cheap, readily available and safe to use. Would you like to receive a collection of my favorite vinegar helpers and how-tos?

You can hang a car deodorizer on the inside of the trash can to help keep it fresh.
