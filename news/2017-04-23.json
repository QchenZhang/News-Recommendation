            "body": "Kyle Lowry and, by extension, his Toronto Raptors have continued their annual postseason struggles this year against the Bucks. (AP Photo/Kelvin Kuo) This was supposed to be the year that things were different for the Toronto Raptors. The combination of finally breaking through and winning a pair of playoff series last season - the first time Toronto had done so in 15 years - and making a pair of shrewd deals at February's trade deadline to bring in forwards Serge Ibaka and P.J. Tucker to fortify depth and versatility at both ends had made Toronto the consensus pick to give the Cleveland Cavaliers a far stiffer test than the Raptors had in last year's Eastern Conference finals. Of course, to properly test the Cavaliers, the third-seeded Raptors need to get past the sixth-seeded Milwaukee Bucks in their first round playoff series. And that is proving to be far from easy as the series is tied 2-2 despite the success Toronto enjoyed last year, along with the upgrades it made in February. Indeed, the Raptors have showed in some ways they are the same old Raptors. [Subscribe to the Monday Morning Post Up, the Washington Post's NBA newsletter] A blowout loss in Game 1 - extending their remarkable record in opening games of playoff series to 1-11, including nine losses in a row - was followed by an equally predictable bounce back victory in Game 2 to even the series. Just when it seemed like Toronto had control of the series, a blowout loss in Milwaukee in Game 3 again left it on the mat and, possibly, out for the count. But these are the Zombie Raptors, so a disastrous game was followed by an inspired one. On Saturday in Game 4, thanks to 33 points from DeMar DeRozan, the Raptors clawed their way back level once again with the young Bucks in an 87-76 win to even the series. The questions about this team remain. And the answers to those questions over the next week could determine the short- and long-term future of the franchise. Make no mistake: Toronto didn't trade Terrence Ross, a first round pick and two second rounders to bring in Ibaka and Tucker at the trade deadline to be struggling to advance out of the first round. General Manager Masai Ujiri saw a chance to build on last season's success, pushed his chips into the middle of the table and went for it. [Blake Griffin's injury is the latest dose of bad luck for the Los Angeles Clippers] So far, though, all those additions have done (in particular Ibaka, who has been excellent in this series) is keep Toronto alive. The team's Achilles' heel in the past - shaky play from its All-Star guards - has come back to haunt it again. DeRozan had 33 points in Game 4, but went 0-for-8 from the floor in a disastrous Game 3. He's 7-for-29 in Toronto's two losses in this series, and 21-for-40 in its two wins. Thus his longstanding struggles in the playoffs - when the game slows down, and some of DeRozan's crafty tricks are less effective - have continued. The more concerning issue, however - as well as the one that could have the biggest impact on Toronto's future - is another disastrous playoff performance from Kyle Lowry. In his time in Toronto, Lowry has undergone a career renaissance. He's gone from a mercurial player who was traded twice early in his career and was largely a bench player before arriving in Toronto to one who's become a multi-time All-Star and an All-NBA selection. That's regular season Kyle Lowry. Playoff Kyle Lowry? That's something else. Through Game 4, Lowry is averaging 39 percent shooting overall and 30.7 percent shooting from three-point range in 35 playoff games with the franchise. That's simply not good enough for a player who has been billed as a franchise cornerstone, and it's those continued struggles for Lowry and DeRozan that have made Toronto as inconsistent as it's been over these past few postseasons. [LeBron James once again shows why he remains in charge of the East] Those struggles will be on Ujiri's mind this summer, when he has to decide what to do as Lowry becomes an unrestricted free agent. As a 10-year veteran, Lowry will be eligible for the 35 percent veteran maximum salary - which, on a five-year deal, would mean his next deal will be worth north of $200 million. Given how much Lowry has struggled in the postseason, will Ujiri be willing to pay up that kind of money to keep him around, especially given Lowry would be 36 years old at the end of such a deal? If Toronto isn't willing to pay Lowry, other teams (like Lowry's hometown Philadelphia 76ers, whose general manager, Bryan Colangelo, brought Lowry to Toronto in the first place) will. The same goes for pending free agents like Ibaka, Tucker and Patrick Patterson, all of whom will be coveted on the open market. It's one thing if Toronto loses a hard-fought series to Cleveland in the second round. It's quite another if the Raptors lose to these Bucks - the team with the best player in the series in Giannis Antetokounmpo, but one that is starting two rookies and is missing another key piece in injured forward Jabari Parker. After last year's successes and February's trades, Toronto was supposed to be past that point. This was supposed to be the postseason that proved that, the playoffs that saw the Raptors become a true challenger to James and the Cavaliers. Instead, it's only proved that the same issues remain for the Raptors. And, depending on what happens over the next three games, it could prove that a new direction is necessary, and the most successful era in franchise history could come to an end.",

            "body": "ATLANTA - The gloomy faces on the Washington Wizards' sideline told the story. John Wall sat closest to the coaching staff, a red towel draped his shoulders - there would be no mistaking it for a cape Saturday night, when Wall's individual moments of brilliance went to waste. Bradley Beal lounged next to Wall, his eyes staring off into the distance, somewhere far away from his Game 3 performance against the Atlanta Hawks. The fourth quarter hadn't even started, but the expressions of the two stars revealed plenty of the 116-98 loss that curbed the Wizards' lead in this best-of-seven first-round series to 2-1. The Hawks controlled the game from tip-off, exploiting Washington's leaky defense for 38 points in the first quarter and opening a 25-point lead before halftime. \"They jumped on us in that first period. Their sense of urgency was very high,\" Wizards Coach Scott Brooks said. \"I wouldn't say that we came out relaxed. We came out missing shots, but we let that affect our defense. That's happened before with us during the season, and it's not pretty.\" Although the Wizards trimmed the lead to 12 in the fourth quarter, Wall spent much of the game carrying the burdens by himself. Atlanta's Paul Millsap had 29 points and 14 rebounds and had a partner in point guard Dennis Schroder, who dazzled for 27 points and nine assists. Wall, however, had to perform alone. He matched Millsap with 29 points, making 10 of 12 shots from the field. Beal, who missed 14 of 20 shots, was the only other Wizards starter in double figures with 12 points. The Wizards' offense sputtered into 41.6 percent shooting and collected just 16 assists. [Jerry Brewer: Wall has been a one-man highlight reel - and that's the problem] \"He has 29. Basically, he's putting the team on his back. That's what he do,\" Wizards forward Markieff Morris said. \"We make shots, he'd finish with 30 and 15 [assists] easy.\" Even as the Hawks' lead ballooned, Wall kept working. He sneered after speeding coast to coast, ditching Schroder with an around-the-back dribble then dunking on Kent Bazemore. He stared down the Hawks' bench once he danced to the corner and lofted a buzzer-beating three-pointer. He smack-talked the courtside fans after finishing at the rim while being fouled. Despite his efforts in the first half, the Wizards went into intermission trailing by 18 with Wall scoring 21 of their 46 points. In the first two games of the series, Beal had shot just 43.7 percent from the field but both times had rediscovered his touch in the fourth quarter. On Saturday, however, Beal started the game 3 for 11 and closed with only three more makes - some of his errant looks even surprised his backcourt mate. \"It's probably the most I've seen him air ball in a game,\" Wall said. \"He'll figure it out.\" Beal missed all six of his attempts from the three-point line. \"I've been in that situation before when Brad was playing well and I was missing shots,\" Wall said. \"Those are good shots that he's been getting all season. \"I bet you tomorrow before practice he's going to get extra shots up, and after practice, to try and find a rhythm,\" Wall said, \"but we're fine. I think he'll be fine. We have the lead 2-1. We just got to take care of what we need to do Monday. I think he'll get out of his shooting slump.\" [It's more of the same for the Clippers, who lose Blake Griffin for the playoffs] As a group, the Wizards could use a breakthrough from the three-point arc. Through the first two games, Washington made 30 percent from deep. It got worse in Game 3 as the Wizards made just 7 of 29 three-point attempts (24.1 percent). Atlanta, meanwhile, broke open the first quarter by unlocking its three-point game. At the start, the Hawks played simple, unselfish basketball and found open shooters beyond the arc. Just as three minutes expired in the opening quarter, Dwight Howard sent a pass to Tim Hardaway Jr., who was waiting beyond the arc. This shot - Atlanta's third open three-pointer off an assist - opened the first double-digit lead. While the Hawks played effortless inside-outside basketball in the first quarter, scoring 18 points in the paint and outfiring the Wizards by plus-12 from beyond the arc, Washington's offense was reduced to perimeter looks and ill-advised decisions. Earlier in the series, the Hawks had strategized to limit Wall and Beal and make other Wizards the primary scorers - a plan that irked Morris. They stuck to that plan in Game 3, and Morris missed his first six attempts. By the midway point of the second quarter, Morris finally drained a three-pointer - a shot he can certainly make but not the most reliable option for the Wizards - and led all players with 12 first-half shot attempts but made just three from the field. Morris finished with nine points (4 for 14) and six rebounds. Late in the fourth quarter, the starters had returned to their seats on the sideline, their faces reflecting a game that was never really a contest. \"They did what they were supposed to do,\" Wall said. \"We took care of home court. They came home, and we knew it was going to be amazing for them to play in front of their great crowd. They did what they were supposed to - come in and get Game 3. Our job is try to put the pressure on them and try to win Game 4.\"",

I can't believe everyone on the team other than Wall and Jennings will forget how to shoot again soon.  But, the lazy defense has happened before -- when they got that \"entitled to win w/o working on defense\" feeling.

Yes, I am pissed cuz we lost a game, but really really pissed off as how we played together.", 
                "And people wonder why Beal was not an all-star this year. Look at the guys that were selected ahead of him and how they are performing each game in the playoffs. Beal, although he has stayed healthy this season, is still too inconsistent in big games. When he decides he wants to be special every game, he will be difficult to deal with. Until then, he is still a work in progress and not an all-star. \n\nBTW, laughing on the bench while you are down by 20+ in the playoffs is not a good look.",

            "body": "The opioid epidemic that has claimed so many lives in Maryland is overwhelming the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. The agency has exceeded national caseload standards - the number of autopsies a single pathologist should perform in a year - in each of the past four years. The office now risks losing its accreditation. \"Everyone continues to add on work hours and work faster and hopefully not take shortcuts,\" said David R. Fowler, Maryland's chief medical examiner. \"They absorb this extra load. But there is a point where they can't continue to add to that and expect the system will function.\" The challenge is not limited to Maryland. The combination of additional and more complex cases is overwhelming medical examiners' offices across the country, particularly along the East Coast, leaving many on the verge of losing accreditation. \"We view this as a national crisis,\" said Brian L. Peterson, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners. The association categorizes the Maryland Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, traditionally well regarded by peers, as \"deficient.\" It will reevaluate the Baltimore-based agency in May. The office can continue to operate without accreditation. But the association warns that performing too many autopsies can jeopardize quality and undermine confidence in the results. The situation has troubling implications for the criminal-justice and public-health systems. Prosecutors rely on autopsy findings and medical examiners' testimony to bolster their cases, and public-health officials use data from the agency to direct resources. State pathologists are performing about 40 percent more autopsies than in 2010 - almost 100 more apiece - and the toxicology lab now runs nearly nonstop, officials say. But the office has not significantly boosted the ranks of examiners and is struggling to hold on to support staff. \"Maryland is currently fully accredited,\" Peterson said. \"But as is the case with many offices, it might be facing loss of that accreditation due to the intersection of caseload and staffing level.\" [Maryland governor declares state of emergency for opioid crisis] The agency is part of the state health and mental hygiene department. Medical examiners investigate deaths caused by injury, homicide or suicide, and those that are untimely, suspicious or not attended by a physician. In Maryland, that's about a third of all deaths. The office handled 14,385 cases in fiscal 2016 and performed 5,439 autopsies. The office began exceeding the national standard of 250 autopsies per examiner per year in fiscal 2013, according to the state health department. Its inability to meet that standard has led to its designation as deficient. After the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the pathologists were on target to perform 328 autopsies - exceeding the limit of 325 for maintaining accreditation. Baltimore County State's Attorney Scott D. Shellenberger, president of the Maryland State's Attorneys' Association, said a loss of accreditation would have an immediate effect on his cases. Prosecutors rely on medical examiners to provide solid autopsies and come to trial prepared to testify. \"In some cases there is a heightened need for forensic evidence to shed light on what actually happened,\" he said. \"You want that to be the easy part of the case, the least challengeable and controversial. If they lose accreditation, it could create some doubt.\" Leana Wen, the Baltimore health commissioner, said she relies on information from the medical examiner's office to develop policy and direct resources. But it isn't always available in a timely manner. She noted, for example, that overdose death totals for 2016 are not yet available from the state health department. She said she has turned to hospital emergency rooms and emergency service providers for immediate information on \"hot spots\" of suspected fentanyl overdoses so officials can warn people in the community. \"Considering the number of overdoses, delays make sense in the medical examiner's office,\" she said. \"But it also can impede our work.\" Fowler listed 17 medical examiners on staff, up from 15 in 2015. He said six more examiners were needed to meet the standards. He requested three in the most recent state budget, out of consideration of the costs, at about $171,000 each. He did not get them. He reported that the office is completing only about three-quarters- of the autopsies in 60 days. The standards call for 90 percent to be completed in that span. In an interview, Fowler said the situation stings, even though he knows many other offices nationally face the same problems. [Virginia makes opioid antidote available to all] He said offices in some other states have racked up backlogs and scaled back services. He said that won't happen in Maryland. Fowler's office was considered deficient once before, because it lacked proper space before a new building opened in 2010. That rating was not based on performance. Fowler said overloaded workers are more likely to make mistakes. Delays mean families wait longer for answers and to claim the bodies of loved ones. The state budget for fiscal 2018, which begins in July, does not include funding for more examiners. Instead, officials added $400,000 to boost salaries for examiners now working longer hours because they do not earn overtime. The agency is also being permitted to fill five open support positions. A health department spokesman said increasing salaries was the priority this year. Spokesman Christopher Garrett said officials are still exploring ways to shift more personnel to the agency. A spokeswoman for Gov. Larry Hogan (R) noted that the budget for the medical examiner's office has increased from $11.4 million in fiscal 2015 to $12.8 million in the coming year. \"Funding for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has increased each year since the governor took office,\" spokeswoman Amelia Chass\u00e9 said. \"The [health] secretary is currently conducting an analysis of the office to determine additional personnel needs, and our administration is committed to meeting those needs.\" Fowler said the office is handling a range of new cases, including those from the spike in homicides in Baltimore. The city has recorded more than 300 killings in each of the past two years, the first and second deadliest on record. But there were far more deaths from overdoses: 1,468 statewide in the first nine months of 2016, up from 1,259 in 2015 and more than twice as many as in 2010. Maryland was one of 30 states to report a large increase in overdose deaths. More than 900 of the fatal overdoses in 2016 were related to heroin. More than 700 were related to fentanyl, a far more powerful opioid that is often mixed with heroin without users' knowledge. Bruce Goldberger, a professor of toxicology at the University of Florida College of Medicine, said that fentanyl has proved to be the greatest challenge for medical examiners. Illicit labs are constantly churning out new formulations, he said, and there are not always good testing methods to identify them. Goldberger, a consultant for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has studied the effects of fentanyl on medical examiner offices. He called the combination of extra cases and more complex cases \"unprecedented.\" \"These new emerging drugs, specifically fentanyl analogues, have a catastrophic effect,\" Goldberger said. His lab performs toxicology testing for several Florida county medical examiners. He said he has seen a surge in requests. \"We are inundated,\" he said, \"and we don't know how to dig out of it.\" Fowler said that he is still hoping for more examiners. He said his staff is extremely dedicated and often works long hours without breaks. But many will qualify for retirement in the next five or six years. Replacing them might not be easy, even with funding. The number of practicing pathologists who work as medical examiners dropped more than 11 percent from 2010 to 2015, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. That was a steeper drop than in any other specialty. \"I think people go to medical school and then choose a specialty based on lifestyle as much as they choose based on what's interesting to them,\" said Janis Orlowski, the group's chief health care officer. \"Perhaps they see people in this area are overworked, as they likely are in the office in Baltimore.\" - Baltimore Sun",

For many of us, that may have seemed to be enough of a good thing, but the local office of the National Weather Service said it wasn't. \"We need far more of it,\" the Weather Service said in a tweet Saturday. That is because the forecasters looked back beyond the drip and drizzle of Saturday, which threatened to turn Earth Day observances into Mud Day. They scrutinized the records back to October of last year. October was not chosen at random: For students of water supply, the water year begins in October. In the report issued Saturday evening, the Weather Service totaled the amount of rain that has fallen at Reagan National Airport and the amount that is expected to fall, from October through Tuesday. They compared that with normal amount of rain in the corresponding period. By that comparison, a lot of rain will have to fall here, and many damp days will have to be endured before we catch up. Normal, for that period, according to Weather Service records, is 21.07 inches. National Airport had measured 13.17 inches through 5 p.m. Saturday. An extra 1.25 was predicted, bringing the total to 14.42. That leaves us a little more than 30 percent below normal for the water year. This is significant. We are in a drought, and the recent rain, according to the Weather Service, \"provides little drought relief.\" This was so despite the fact that the recent rain and the rain that is expected are the useful kind of rain, which does not run swiftly into drains, storm sewers and waterways. Instead, it \"will soak into the ground,\" the Weather Service message said. That is where it is stored until needed to replenish rivers and reservoirs in dryer times. So, although it may seem counterintuitive, many more softly rainy days will be required for us to banish the drought.",

Price finished with 37 wins, a 2.23 goals against average, a save percentage of .923 and three shutouts. Holtby finished behind Bobrovsky with a 2.07 goals against average and his save percentage ranked third in the league at .925.

(Winslow Townson / USA Today Sports) FOXBOROUGH, Mass. - D.C. United Coach Ben Olsen has been talking up his roster depth since training camp in Florida, and on a cool, clammy New England night seven weeks into the season, he put his faith in the reserves to the test. With six injured starters out of the lineup Saturday, United created a wealth of danger in a free-flowing MLS match and seized its first away point with a 2-2 draw against the New England Revolution before an announced 16,591 at Gillette Stadium. Jared Jeffrey and Sebastien Le Toux scored two minutes apart in the first half, but United (2-3-2) conceded the equalizer shortly after intermission against New England (2-3-3), which was playing its second game in four days. Given the circumstances, United shouldn't have any qualms with the outcome. What gnawed at Olsen and the players was conceding goals early in each half. \"We performed well for maybe 80 minutes,\" Le Toux said. \"The first five minutes of each half we were maybe not as awake as the rest of the game.\" The personnel issues played a part. United center back Steve Birnbaum, the captain, sat out with a concussion. Midfielder Patrick Nyarko (hamstring) and defender Nick DeLeon (groin) stayed behind. Forward Patrick Mullins seemed set to rejoin the group after recovering from a hamstring ailment but, as a precaution, remained in Washington. Playmaker Luciano Acosta (sore ankle) and left back Taylor Kemp (illness) traveled but didn't start. Kofi Opare, in place of Birnbaum, made his first start of the year. Maxim Tissot, in place of Kemp, made his first appearance of the year. Lamar Neagle, in place of Nyarko, made his first start of the year. Le Toux was in the lineup for the first time, getting the nod instead of Jose Guillermo Ortiz, who had started the previous three games. Sean Franklin started for DeLeon. And Jeffrey and Marcelo Sarvas partnered in central midfield, putting the onus on rookie Ian Harkes to create in Acosta's absence. Just 4 \u00bd minutes into the match, New England's Kei Kamara swung a cross that met Lee Nguyen on the run behind Opare for a six-yard header into the near corner for his fourth goal of the campaign. \"It was very disappointing,\" Jeffrey said. \"We talked a lot about reactions this week, especially after last week giving up a goal so early in the second half\" of a scoreless game against the New York Red Bulls. Harkes had a grand threat in the 14th minute, ripping a 20-yarder off the left post. Bill Hamid made a soaring touch save on Kamara's header and a diving slap on Diego Fagundez's distant effort. United drew even in the 26th minute. Jeffrey pounced on Kamara's clearance of Sarvas's cross, slicing an 18-yard one-timer beyond Cody Cropper's extension and into the right corner for his first goal since last July in Toronto. Two minutes later, Lloyd Sam played a through ball ahead of Le Toux in stride. Cropper raced off his line, figuring he could beat the forward to it. He miscalculated. Le Toux got there first and flipped the ball over the keeper and into the far corner before retreating Josh Smith could catch up for his 58th regular season goal on the occasion of his 200th start. The opportunities continued to flow right up to intermission: Cropper made sterling saves on Franklin and Opare, and Harkes's header hit the crossbar. New England needed less than three minutes of the second half to level the score. Off a corner kick, Antonio Delamea headed from the back side to the six-yard box, where Juan Agudelo appeared to stab it on target. Official scoring ruled an own goal on Franklin. Nonetheless, the Revolution had earned it. United struck the frame for the third time on Neagle's glancing header in the 61st minute. Hamid made a soaring stop on Kamara's bid in the 73rd. Olsen turned to his bench, bringing on Ortiz and Acosta. The Revolution, though, was the greater threat to scoring a late goal. Kamara's close-range blast crashed off the near post and the hosts buzzed with threats down the stretch. New England finished with 15 corner kicks. \"It's a very satisfying point,\" Olsen said. \"We're not happy about starting off the game and the second half in that way, but the chances we created, the ability to bounce back in the first half and then to hold on down the stretch\" offered encouragement heading into the last leg of a three-game away stretch next Sunday at expansion Atlanta.

            "body": "ATLANTA - The John Wall playoff highlight reel has yet to disappoint. In three postseason games, Wall has produced enough wow moments to satisfy the entire spring, raising his superstar profile and carrying the Washington Wizards in this opening round. And though it has been wonderful and necessary, though you'd be a fool to want less from him, it's time to see more from the rest of the Wizards. As the Wizards opened this best-of-seven series with two home victories over the Atlanta Hawks, Wall's splendid performance masked some of the uncharacteristic missed shots and spotty play of his teammates. But in Game 3 on Saturday, the Wizards needed one of their trademark balanced offensive outings to counter the Hawks' energy and hot shooting. The Wizards didn't have it, though. So they lost, 116-98, at Philips Arena, ruining a chance to push Atlanta to the brink of elimination. Washington remains in a favorable position, owning a 2-1 series lead, but now the Wizards must find better answers to their problems. In this game, defense was a shortcoming, as it often is with this team. However, there is a larger issue related to this series: Why are the Wizards shooting so many bricks? Specifically, why are they missing so many open looks? [Wizards stumble from the start, fall in Game 3] Playoff jitters is no longer an acceptable explanation. We're three games into the postseason, and the Wizards are still off. They picked a bad time to be slumping. Wall was again on his game Saturday, making 10 of 12 field goals, scoring 29 points and dishing seven assists. For the series, he is averaging 31 points and 10 assists, and he is shooting 55.4 percent. Marcin Gortat is shooting 60 percent, but the center is only getting 8.3 shots a game. And backup point guard Brandon Jennings has made 8 of his 13 attempts. But the rest of the Wizards who have taken at least 20 shots are practicing masonry. Otto Porter Jr. is shooting 40 percent. Bradley Beal is at 39.7 percent. Markieff Morris is at 36.1. Kelly Oubre Jr. is at 35, and Bojan Bogdanovic is at 25. As a team, the Wizards are making just 27.8 percent of their three-pointers through three games, down from 37.2 during the regular season. Remove Wall, who has made 5 of 7 from behind the arc, and the Wizards are shooting 23.6 percent from deep. [Best and worst from the Wizards' loss in Game 3] Yes, the Wizards need to play better defense. Atlanta made 15 of its first 21 shots on Saturday. Paul Millsap had 29 points and 14 rebounds. Dennis Schroder finished with 27 points and nine assists, and rookie Taurean Prince added 16 points on efficient 7-for-10 shooting. You can't win a playoff game at home guarding that poorly, let alone on the road against an opponent essentially playing for its season. But after watching the Wizards for 85 games, it should be apparent now that defense rarely carries them. This is an offense-centric team. It's no surprise the Wizards lost a game and concluded they have defensive mistakes to clean up. It's far more troubling that the thing they do best has been shaky thus far. \"We're missing wide open shots,\" Morris said. \"We must have had, like, 30 of them in the first half alone. It seemed like our legs were heavy or something. It was one of those days. We'll bounce back. I'm not taking nothing away from them, but we're better than that.\" The Wizards have to be better because, for as fantastic as Wall has been, the team is at its best when everyone eats. Wall is a pass-first point guard. He'd rather distribute. When you see him averaging 31 points in a series, it indicates both that he's an amazing player and that the Wizards are using his scoring as a crutch. He's most dangerous, the team is most dangerous, when he scores in the 20-25 range and adds 10-15 assists. [The Raptors have having a nasty case of deja vu] During the regular season, Wall scored at least 30 points a dozen times; the Wizards were just 6-6 in those games. In his two highest-scoring games - 52 points against Orlando in December and 41 against the Los Angeles Clippers in March - the Wizards were losers. On the other hand, they had a 12-3 record when Wall recorded at least 14 assists. Perhaps he would've had that many assists in Game 3, but too often, Wall made the meal, set the table and lit the candles, but the Wizards still refused to eat. Said Morris: \"He should've had 30 points and 15 assists, at least, in this game.\" Said Wall: \"We had a lot of great looks, a lot of missed shots. We have to be better.\" Beal likes to express confidence in his shot by saying, \"A miss is a lady.\" If that's so, he has met a lot of women in this series. And they haven't been nice to him. \"You know what? I like his looks,\" Coach Scott Brooks said of Beal. \"I've been saying it for the last couple of games. I like his shots. He's just going to have to keep shooting them. We're going to have to keep getting him open looks like we have. Every player will go through a stretch of games, a few games, where you're not going to shoot the ball well. He'll bounce back. The guy's a big winner, and he's going to come out and make shots, hopefully next game.\" The Wizards shouldn't fret right now. For six months, they proved they were one of the NBA's most efficient offenses. They can't make too much of three games. They can't make too much of one loss in which they missed 22 of 29 three-pointers. They should find hope in how well they're running their offense. Most of the time, they're getting what they want. They could be more mindful of getting the ball inside and playing more inside-out, but no major offensive adjustments are necessary. They just have to make shots - and not let the misses affect their defense. \"We kind of have to flush the toilet on this game,\" forward Jason Smith said. \"This was a bad game for us. It was a good game for them.\" The Wizards knew the Hawks would play with desperation in Game 3. They knew to expect an early rush. Still, in building a 25-point lead in the first quarter, the Hawks opened with more ferocity than the Wizards could handle. So this is a series now, sort of. In Game 4, the Wizards wouldn't mind seeing Wall race coast to coast and go behind his back for a dunk again. But what they need most is much more routine: A pass to an open shooter, who then sets his feet, flicks his wrist and grins as the net ripples.

We don't need Jennings and Wall in the game at the same time.  When Beal goes to the bench, we need the substitution to be someone who can hit open shots. Burke proved he could do that vs. Miami, even with all the time on the bench.  Even though Jennings has made shots in this series, Trey Burke is the better outside shooter.  And Jennings is not a defensive stopper!!  When Wall comes to bench, sub in Jennings.  When Beal goes to bench, particularly at the end of the 1st quarter which is Brooks pattern, put in Burke. The WIZ need another jump shooter to produce, particularly since Bogy doesn't really have it right now, nor has he had it the last month or so!",

With all the Wiz Centers being over 30, have said all year they should have one more vet Center on their roster for insurance.  Ochefu has not shown any clues that he's ready for the NBA.  On top of that SB loves to go smaller and smaller.  This eliminates your interior D and ability to rebound on both ends.  Wiz had no offensive rebounds.  SB had the thin Oubre guarding Milsap, short Jennings guarding the tall Shroder - - maybe try a 1-2-2 zone with your 2nd unit?",

                "The solution is sitting on the bench nursing a strained calf: Ian Mahinmi.  When Mahinmi enters the game, Coach Brooks can give Gortat a well deserved rest that keeps him out of foul trouble, as Brooks rests all the other regulars using his second unit with fresh legs to press opponents and funnel their drives in the paint towards a shot blocker clogging the middle. Mahinmi can play physical defense without fouling out. That's why they pay him the (14 million) big bucks. \n\nThis strategy has consistently helped the Wizards stage impressive 4th quarter comebacks as defensive rebounds fuel an effective fast break. Jason Smith and Bogdanovic can concentrate on easy baskets. After January when Mahinmi returned from his 51 game absence, the Wizards hit their stride and began their impressive home winning streak. Let's hope Mahinmi comes back in time without having to go through an extended slump while he gears up to NBA playoff intensity.",

            "body": "Markieff Morris makes Paul Millsap earn two at the free throw line. (AP Photo/John Bazemore) ATLANTA - Washington Wizards forward Markieff Morris continues to make the first postseason series of his career a memorable one - mostly with his words. While many players might opt for cliched praise for opponents as to not needlessly stir the pot, Morris has grabbed the biggest spoon he could find and mixed personal animosity into this first-round playoff series against the Atlanta Hawks. His target: four-time all-star Paul Millsap. After the Hawks' dominating Game 3 performance (a 116-98 trouncing) in which Millsap played his best game of the series (29 points and 14 rebounds), Morris offered a backhanded compliment - then a verbal suplex. [Brewer: John Wall has been a one-man highlight reel - and that's the problem] \"Good game. He did more for his team tonight. Me as a man, you know, you take your wins with your losses and I take my wins with my losses all the time.\" Morris said. \"You know, he did more for his team. He's a crybaby. You get all the calls and you a crybaby. That's how I'm looking at it.\" After the game, Millsap sat beside teammate Dennis Schroder for the post-game media session. When Millsap heard Morris's comments, he groaned while Schroder exclaimed: \"Oh, my God! ... No.\" Round 4 of #WizHawks #MorrisMillsap should be fun to watch. Monday can't come soon enough #dcfamily pic.twitter.com/bdZKTLU9ir - Hoop District (@HoopDistrictDC) April 23, 2017 Asked if the matchup between himself and Morris had grown personal, Millsap responded: \"It definitely got personal now, yes.\" [Wizards-Hawks Game 3 best and worst] Then, Millsap smirked, and Schroder covered his face. \"I mean, I don't care. So what,\" Millsap said. \"Take his loss and go back to the hotel. Be ready for the next game.\" The Morris-Millsap dynamic has boiled since the start of the series. Before the opening game, Morris dissed the stretch-four label as \"soft\" but tagged Millsap as a stretch-four forward. Then the war of words truly began when after the Wizards' Game 1 win, as Millsap disparaged Washington for \"playing MMA.\" Morris countered by coining the phrase\"double MMA\" - and the combined 55 personal fouls in Game 2 mirrored as much. Also, Morris did not appreciate another Millsap comment that the \"Hawks want to let\" players other than John Wall and Bradley Beal score. [Wizards stumble from the start, fall to Atlanta, 116-98, in Game 3] By Saturday, the rivalry erupted again, and judging by Morris's words, he felt Millsap whined for foul calls. In Game 3 Morris took 14 shots but did not attempt a free throw. However, Millsap was rewarded with nine foul shots. By the 6:08 mark of the second quarter, Millsap had recorded three trips to the free-throw line and who knows if that was the reason that fired up Morris, but after draining a three-pointer, Morris immediately got close to Millsap's face and barked at him all the way down the court. However, that was Morris's lone highlight against Millsap. Looking more like an all-star, Millsap scored the bulk of his 12 field goals against Morris. Since Game 1 when Morris made his playoff debut with a strong performance of 21 points, seven rebounds and four blocks, he has not reached double figures over the next two games, finishing with three and nine points, respectively.",

                "....ok, ok, blah blah. \nI want to know why Beal and Porter can NOT shoot the ball in the basket. They are missing open shots. Wall is hitting shots he doesn't normally make. \nWhat gives???",

Game three, I don't know why Brooks only played him 20 minutes. The team is usually much better with him on the floor if you ask me. Exceptions to that include when match-ups include calls for such as Oubre's defense on a SF superstar or a bigger body for more banging.", 
                "In reading some of these comments you would think the Wizards is the team that is down 2-1 in the series. Morris had 21 pts. and 7 rebounds in game one but has been affected by some questionable foul calls that has been a benefit to Millsap after he made the MMA comments about game one.  The disparity in free throw attempts in favor of the Hawks is ridiculous, 109 to 70 and 77 to 50 in the first two Wizards home games.  The Wizards is at their best when they get out and run by not allowing the other team to set their defense but they can't do that when the other is shooting free throws all the time.", 
                "The reason for the disparity in free throw attempts is plain and simple.  The Wizards cannot stop dribble penetration.  They haven't all season and they won't the rest of the playoffs.  I watched a lot of their games this season and it was always the same.  When the opposition used the shot clock and didn't take quick outside shots, the Wizards struggled to keep up or pull ahead.  Everyone in the league knows it that is why they have scouts.", 
                "The Wizards haven't had Mahinmi, Jennings and Bogdanovic \"all season.\" The Wizards haven't had a season under Coach Brooks until now. Jason Smith and Kelly Oubre, Jr. have improved under him -- especially on defense. Oubre in particular has had success stopping opponents' dribble penetration, and Smith has added some crucial blocks in addition to making it more physically costly for opponent penetrators to get their two points -- often from the FT line, yes, but still.\n\nWhen Mahinmi returns, he'll add some similar fouling, yes, but also up to 7 steals a game and a couple of blocks.\n\nOne of the guys Oubre has defended well, btw, iirc -- or at least, whose game he affected in that last fourth quarter against them -- is Isaiah Thomas.", 
                "This messages is for the other fourteen players on the team. Not John Wall. A wise man said IT'S A LOT OF PLAYERS THAT ARE TALENTED AND CAN PLAY THE GAME BUT THERE IS NOT A LOT OF PLAYERS THAT KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO BE CHAMPIONS. It's easy PREPARE AND FOCUS. THAT'S HOW YOU BECOME CHAMPIONS.", 
                "With the exception of John Wall everybody else did not play well in game three.  Morris has been trash talking before the start of the series when he said he's a power forward and not a stretch four. \"Call Millsap a stretch four.  Stretch four's are soft\", said Morris.\n\nI am reading some of these comments and smiling about why fans are called fickle. Morris had 21 pts. and 7 rebounds in game one and got the better of Millsap but all of sudden he is underperforming.  Morris and a bunch of other Wizards frontline players got into foul trouble in the second game and spent most of the time on the bench. Game three was a desperation game for the Hawks and the Wizards as a team did not match Atlanta's intensity and missed a bunch of open shots (Bradley Beal).\n\nMorris is right in pointing out Millsap's whinniness about physical plays and him getting all the calls.  In the three games the Hawks have been to the free throw line 109 times compared to the wizards 70. Millsap has been to the free line 35 times.  The Wizards are getting frustrated with some of the touch calls and it is affecting their play.  The foul calls are slowing down the Wizards game and helps the Hawks to get into their defense when they come off the free throw line.", 
                "Calls won't get more favorable because Morris belittles Millsap.  They will get even worse.  He needs to shut his mouth and fire up his motor.  He was getting called for fouls for the reason he often gets a lot of fouls -- he was lazy and slow on defense in games two and three.",

                "Morris should shut his mouth and be concerned about stepping up his game.  Milsap has had his way with him.", 
                "Wow, ok then. But I don't think I've ever seen a whinier team than the Wizards. They cry for foul on every single play it seems.

                "Now i'm beginning to understand why Morris became available to the Wiz...He shows flashes of being a very good player on both ends of the court, but making childish statements particularly after a LOSS smacks of immaturity.\n\nNo team ever won a game with their mouth as Morris will find out if the Wiz keep playing they way they did yesterday.\n\nTime for the leader of this team to tell Morris to just shut up and play!!!!!",

But an incident reported in Montgomery County on Saturday night still seemed a bit different. It was a little beyond the norm in the kinds of pets that were found after the fire at a house on Oriental Street in the Wheaton Woods neighborhood of Rockville. The animal occupants included, according to county fire and rescue spokesman Pete Piringer, not only the frequently found dog but also birds, a hedgehog and a lizard. No injuries were reported to any humans, although it appeared that a family would be displaced, Piringer said. Nor was any injury reported to the dog, the birds or the hedgehog. However, things appeared perhaps a little iffy with the reptile. The lizard, Piringer reported, was \"being evaluated.\"",

In addition to the three April 6 tornadoes already confirmed in the District and adjacent suburbs, the Weather Service said last week that it has established that four others touched down in Virginia's Fauquier and Orange counties. Of those four, it appeared that one of the most dramatic in its effects occurred along Route 522 in Orange County, where metal roofing and siding were stripped from a business, and some of the material was carried aloft, landing about 2,000 feet away. Two people who witnessed the twister saw debris flung into the air and swirling around. In all four of the newly reported tornadoes, maximum winds were estimated at 80 or 85 mph, 10 or 15 mph stronger than in the three reported earlier. Near New Baltimore, in Fauquier County, one tornado left many trees either snapped, topped or uprooted. Fences blew down, and a roof was partially torn from a barn over a mile-long path. Most homes on the path had damage to shingles, gutters and siding, and several sheds were either destroyed or severely damaged, the Weather Service said. Another of the Fauquier tornadoes snapped trees near Airlie, on Airline Road. It snapped and uprooted trees \"all along Blantyre Road,\" the Weather Service said. It said the continuous path of damaged trees halted just before the storm reached Interstate 66. One of the three twisters confirmed earlier struck in both Arlington and the District. Another touched down near Joint Base Bolling-Anacostia in the District, and a third in the Herndon and Sterling Park areas.",

The win improved the Orioles' major league-best record to 12-4. Aquino (1-0) held Boston to two runs and six hits. Baltimore struggled to solve knuckleballer Steven Wright through the first three innings after hammering four home runs off him April 12 at Fenway Park, but it caught up to him again in the fourth. It batted around to score four runs, three on back-to-back homers by Trey Mancini and Jonathan Schoop. Adam Jones drove in the Orioles' final run with a two-out single. Mancini's eighth homer in his first 17 games tied a major league record held by Carlos Delgado and Trevor Story. Mychal Givens took over for Aquino and pitched two perfect innings before Donnie Hart and Darren O'Day pitched the ninth inning, with O'Day getting the last out for his first save of the year. Jackie Bradley Jr. hit his first home run of the season in the third inning for the Red Sox, a two-run shot that gave Boston a 2-0 lead. - Baltimore Sun",

            "body": "Dear Carolyn: I've been happily married to a wonderful man for the last four years. My husband has a teenage son from his previous marriage, but we've decided not to have kids of our own. Last week I was boxing up papers from our office and came upon a printed email from my father-in-law to his financial planner. In the email, my father-in-law asked the financial planner how to ensure that my stepson receives the remainder of my in-laws' estate after my husband dies. The financial planner suggested a couple of options, one of which was a generation-skipping trust that would pass to my stepson upon my husband's death, regardless of whether I or my husband pass on first. I was surprised and incredibly hurt by the question from my father-in-law, since I am younger than my husband and there is a good chance I will outlive him. While I sympathize with his desire to pass something down to his grandson, it seems cruel and unnecessary to do so by leaving me with nothing when I am a widow. Still, it's his family's money and not mine, and I feel guilty for even caring. But I am genuinely scared for my financial future now, and deeply hurt by my in-laws' coldness. Am I wrong to be upset? Should I ask my husband to talk to them about it? - Anonymous Anonymous: Your being upset is understandable. It would be a mistake, though, to stick with those hurt feelings as your only response. No one wants to be called untrustworthy, which is the message you're getting from the letter. Your father-in-law (\"Phil\") doesn't trust you to be the one to ensure his grandson inherits his estate. As I said, it's understandable that this would sting. But if you were this teenage boy's mother, how would you feel if his inheritance from Phil went through a stepmother before going to him - if in fact it ever did go to him? You'd stand for that? I have to think not, no matter how highly you regarded the stepmother's character. In fact, it's such a huge thing to entrust to anyone that not being trusted is - for these purposes as least - not even a personal slight. I can see not wanting to be trusted with this. Leave what's mine to me, thanks, but don't put me in charge of anyone else's share because I don't need that grief. Accordingly, the transaction you've witnessed here is a commonplace. People routinely secure assets for their immediate families because even one variable or third party can leave the intended heir with nothing. So. Take your moment to be upset, then reframe as needed to see the practical wisdom in what Phil wants to do. Then go a step further and think pragmatically about your own position here. What will happen if your husband does predecease you? Will you be left with nothing? Will your stepson own your home? These not only are important questions in their own right, but they're also (more or less) independent of Phil's arrangements for your stepson. You and your husband have your own shared lives, and presumably that includes some assets, so you need to discuss how you'll provide for each other in your wills to ensure neither is left homeless or broke. Raise it not with \"Hey, why is he getting everything while I get nothing,\" but with \"I stumbled across this email and it made me realize we haven't gotten our own estate plans in order. We need to make sure neither of us is in for a nasty surprise.\" Hi, Carolyn: What do you recommend about meeting the partner's first wife? We have been together a year, are serious, committed and secure in our relationship. I will meet his ex-wife this spring at their child's graduation, but I am not looking forward to it. I'm kind of okay with this step and he and I have talked about it, but I do have a voice in my head reminding me that, with children and a marriage, they have a bond that I might never have with him. I would appreciate any tips. - Anonymous Anonymous: With everyone he knows and has ever known, he has a bond you'll never have with him. There's no ex-spouse monopoly here. And you, likewise, will have a bond with him that no one else ever will. Individual + individual = unique pairing. Period. The sooner you own what you have for what it is, inherently and uncorrupted by what-ifs and who-elses - who can, by the way, include parents and sibs and best buddies as well as exes, since all represent his deep history - the better able you will be just to meet any of his people as a fellow traveler as opposed to wrangler of baggage. So just be friendly and flexible - and be on the margins, please. A graduation is about the grad, so if the spotlight nicks you wherever you happen to stand, graciously step to the side.

                "Honestly, I find this sort of thinking fascinating. It isn't my money. I didn't work for it, I didn't earn it, I have no claim to it. He's not even my father. But by god when that old man dies, some of it should come to me! I deserve to be taken care of!\n\nI'd really like to know when the email was written. Particularly with respect to the wedding date. Before? Soon after? Recently? They've only been married four years. Maybe FIL knows about the miserable success rate for second marriages (particularly those that involve minor children) and is waiting to see if LW has staying power. I can't say that I'd blame him.", 
                "this is the nightmare second wife or third wife for all children of the first wife. Yes, she's a gold digger, digger digger.", 
                "That's some mighty leaps you are taking, to assume that someone is a gold digger because she's wondering about her future financial security.  I think the most you can say is that she might have assumed that when her FIL passed that her son would get the money, so that would be part of their financial security.  She just found out that's not true.  I wouldn't be judgmental about it at all.", 
                "The most charitable interpretation is that LW1 is relatively young and hasn't given much thought to estate planning and different scenarios that could happen.", 
                "Slight variation of topic: It's not just about wills.  A lot of people forget to update their life insurance, pension or 401K, and other financial accounts when they divorce or remarry.  The money then goes to whoever was named as beneficiary, even if circumstances, spouses, and descendants have changed since the beneficiaries were designated.   The beneficiaries listed on an IRA, for example, will receive that money, regardless of what the will states.  It behooves people to review their arrangements regularly, and to consider not just the will but all financial holdings.", 
                "From comments below I am reminded of a sad story about a friend's sister. She was the second wife, not that it matters really. But her husband worked for the family business, their home which he lived in before her was owned by the family business, their cars were leased by the family business.   She came into the marriage without any assets due to poor early adult choices and she worked for the family business. Her husband's family did not like her. He died in middle age and she was left in a very unfortunate position.\n\nThe thing she should have done is made sure there was life insurance. If needed she should have paid the premiums so she knew it was in place and would not lapse. That one little, easy step would have made all the difference.", 
                "Have life insurance, get everything in writing. And I know a few people who work for the family business without actually getting a salary. Room and board seem to be enough pay in their view. (???) If you work for the family you should get a salary or at least a big retirement account contribution. \n\nEverything should be in writing. I know I posted yesterday (?) about reading somewhere the man who had a big tract of land, encouraged his kids to build houses on it then suddenly sold the whole thing, houses included.\nOh and have a contingency plan.  I know of people who plan everything around the assumption the husband will die first. That doesn't always happen. I know of a woman who was the picture of health, seemingly, and 10 years younger than her husband, and died very suddenly (aneurysm)", 
                "LW1 needs to get a job to provide for herself after her husband dies. She has an incredible amount of nerve getting upset that her father-in-law wants to make sure his grandson receives his inheritance. Her in-laws owe her nothing. She wants to make sure she isn't reduced to eating cat food if her husband dies first? Get a job, mija!", 
                "Or get life insurance on hubby. How hard is that? (Presuming he is relatively healthy)",

                "As a widow, stepmother, and someone who lost both parents within the past few years, I have this to say. It is a very bad idea to plan what to do with someone else's money - money that frankly you're not really entitled to. He's your father-in-law. It's you and your husband who should be planning for your financial futures. Your father-in-law's money is his and his alone to do with as he pleases. You and your husband should be doing everything you can to ensure that you are both taken care of if one or the other of you passes regardless of who is older. And please get mortgage insurance so the house is paid off if the owner dies. As they like to say, keep your own house in order, and don't worry about someone else's.", 
                "preach, girl!!!!", 
                "LW1  reminds me of an episode of Kitchen Nightmares, \"The Burger Kitchen.\"", 
                "My husband's grandparents had the forethought to create a generation-skipping trust. The 4 grandchildren received an inheritance from their grandparents. Otherwise, they would have received nothing. The second wife (step mother) got everything, and would not even give them a memento of their father. It is heartbreaking for me to watch this play out.", 
                "I can identify with LW1.  After 30 years of marriage my husband died, he always knew he would receive money from his mother at her death and did not save like he should have.  Since his death was before hers, she changed her will leaving our daughter his share with no access to any funds until she is 30.  We have college and other expenses he acquired before his death, so we are struggling especially since he had no life insurance and his dependence on this inheritance.", 
                "Sorry to hear that. This is a cautionary tale on how not to run your life.\n\nAlways make sure you have life insurance, always keep debt in check, always save for your retirement and other needs, never count on someone else's money. For all you know this would have played out the same anyway, what if your husband did not die, but his mother lived to 105, the last 20 years in assisted living. You would have gotten next to nothing and what you did get would have been too late to save you.", 
                "Wow, this  letter really made me shake my head. Aside from the fact that only a few years ago, LW1  would not have had a husband or a father in law to rely on, the idea that a child's grandfather should take some of what he has to pass on and give it to  his second daughter in law is really odd. As I planned my estate, I chose  to leave most of my assets to my daughter, and to my grandchildren if my daughter predeceases me. My daughter-in-law will get some money of her own from me.  But my first responsibility is to care for my child and my grandchildren, and the safest way to be sure that something doesn't happen which pulls the funds away from my grandchildren to place it in the hands of the woman I have known since the day she was born. This is not about being ungenerous- It's about taking care of future generations and privileging that.  I will note that my own parents made a decision to set aside almost everything for a sibling who would always need extra care. That meant that I did not receive what some might consider a \"fair share\".  maybe someday there will be something left that will flow to me or my child, or maybe not. And that's life. I'm a big girl and know money does not mean love or create happiness.", 
                "I wish LW1's husband would recognize himself in this letter and hire an attorney--get out now for your sake and the sake of your son.", 
                "On the second letter, I have to disagree with Carolyn's advice. When  you get married and have kids with somebody, that is a serious bond. It's not comparable to your relationship with a coworker or your doctor. That's two people creating a life together. \nBut, I think LW doesn't need to worry about it. While it's normal to be a bit insecure about his past relationship... It's obviously over and done with, and the fact that they are polite with each other shows that they've both moved on with their lives.", 
                "My ex-husband died recently and left everything to his second wife (most of which was siphoned out of our joint bank account, with me as breadwinner). My kids get nothing. My grandkids get nothing. \n\nHe told his new wife to give the girls various things (supposedly there is a list somewhere). I think it's pretty clear that older will NOT get the house &amp; property &amp; younger will NOT get the business as he intended. Hopefully they will get some family antiques and photos but (per the will) new wife isn't legally required to give them squat.", 
                "I don't really understand. He intended to leave things to your daughters, but he did not express those intentions in a will?", 
                "he expressly dis-inherited them as the new wife threatened to not take care of him if he did not make her sole heir. He became severely disabled, unable to stand, feed or dress himself, barely able to talk. However she says she may give them a few things. His fault for not rewriting the will, or writing it the way he wanted to originally.",

She DID do the caregiving- however I was married to him for 30 years &amp; would have gladly done it myself- I have a good income &amp; health insurance. She had neither. His choice tho.\n\nHow well did she do? - let's just say she was being investigated for elder abuse when he died. She cut off his food &amp; water. Again- perfectly legal- she had POA.

                "I was imagining possibilities like a family run business, a family owned home where the inlaws moved out so the husband could live in it, or the house has an expensive mortgage that the widow wouldn't be able to keep up.  Hopefully LW1 will take this as a reminder to do what she should have done long ago - get her own financial house in order and figure out what her husband's intentions are.  Better now than after a funeral.", 
                "A wife needs to know what her financial circumstances are.  FIL has every right to leave his own money to whomever he pleases, but husbands (and wives) should be open and forthcoming with each other about what assets will be available after the death or either spouse.   Both spouses should be concerned about providing for the remaining spouse, as well as any dependent minor children.  \n\nBut it is rather presumptuous to assume that the second wife will be able to start a career and earn her own retirement after the death of her spouse.  We don't know how old these people are or what their circumstances are.", 
                "She implies she's young enough to have children. And why can't she work while he's alive?", 
                "Maybe she can.  Maybe she does.  Maybe not.  Maybe her job does not provide life insurance or a matching 401K.  It's really hard to set a hard and fast rule for someone else's life without knowing all the circumstances.   I don't see the LW as a gold digger or a leech.  I do think she has a right to KNOW what is going on financially, and she is right to be concerned about what her future may hold, preferably in time to DO something about it.\n \n Whether or not she has her own retirement, it is not unreasonable for her to expect some provision from her husband (though not from her father in law).  One should not leave one's spouse high and dry, if at all possible to avoid doing so.", 
                "LW1 seems confused.  Why in the world would her father-in-law be concerned with providing for her?? Is she disabled?  Unable to work for some reason?  Why can't she take care of herself?  Sounds like he's on to her, and making sure his grandson actually gets his money, which it seems he rightly figures would not happen should he just leave it to his son.  She sounds very mercenary to me.", 
                "This is interesting. We will  leave money separately to our kids and grandkids, and right now give substantial cash and other gifts to our kids. Of course it benefits our kids' spouses and SOs, at least indirectly. Say I give a check for 20K to our kid, she could endorse it over to her husband if she wanted to. Generally this happens at Christmas and from what I hear they buy a few things and put the balance in the kids' savings/college accounts. Our childless child is using hers to go back for a graduate degree. Of course some benefits the SO but we don't care.", 
                "LW1 felt fine about her financial future UNTIL...she found out that her FIL's money was probably going to her FIL's grandson. Interestingly, she did not wonder about her husband being hurt about FIL's legacy going to the grandson. LW1 does not sound like someone who married entirely for the right reasons. She had her eye on her FIL's $ from day one. \nAnd there is more missing from this story; what were the circumstances of her husband's divorce from his first wife and the mother of the grandchild? My in-laws disinherited their son in favor of my children, their grandchildren for the direct purpose of making certain that the woman their son left me for would NEVER profit from any inheritance. \nPassing down a legacy is for one's spouse, or blood relatives,  profoundly cherished friends and charities. NOT for the financial benefit of second spouses of one's children, especially if there are no children from the second marriage.", 
                "Passing down a legacy is for whatever the person passing it down wants it to be for. I happen to still be on my first spouse, but I'm wondering what's inherently superior about a first spouse, and why a second spouse should receive nothing. That's completely up to the giver, and varies according to the situation.",

                "Two points:\n\nFirst, the in-laws have known and probably loved and enjoyed their grandson since he was a baby.  Their memories of him probably include many endearing interactions while he was growing up.  By contrast, they have only known the LW for about 4 years, and the relationship has been one of equals, adult to adult.\n\nAnd second, the LW doesn\u2019t actually know that the in-laws plan to leave her with \u201cnothing\u201d when she is a widow.  For all she knows they might have written her in for $1,000,000!  OK, probably not THAT much, but you get the idea.  The remainder is not necessarily the whole of the estate.", 
                "Why should they leave her anything?   Her financial well being is between her and her husband.", 
                "Whether or not she has any right to expect anything, all she has is an email from her FIL asking about options. She has no idea what they actually decided to do, and she will probably never know with any certainty, which is another reason for her not to be depending on an inheritance for her financial security.",

Problem is, he set it up 25 years ago, and tuition rates have skyrocketed since then.  There are several grandchildren in private school and college at this time.  The trust is only able to pay a small amount of each grandchild's expenses, instead of paying everything as my father intended.  One grandchild recently had to forego a surgery that could have benefitted him (a small repair to an old injury in his hand) because the trust didn't have enough money to pay for it, his parents didn't have enough money to pay for it (they'd spent their own inheritance long ago), and insurance didn't cover it.

            "body": "Dear Amy: I am a 67-year-old divorced, single woman. I live about 10 minutes from my daughter and babysit for my 18-month-old granddaughter two days a week. My daughter pays me a little bit, and I use that money to buy lunch food and snacks. My granddaughter's brother is almost 9. My daughter wants me to keep both children during summer vacation, but I know that my grandson will be very bored. All he wants to do is play games on my Kindle. There is not much I can do that will interest two children with such a large age span. My problem is that I love my grandchildren very much, but I really don't enjoy babysitting - I just don't have the energy or creativity to keep the children occupied. There are so many other volunteer positions and activities I'd rather be doing than staying in and babysitting. My daughter complains that they don't have the money for child care, and yet they have money for their own interests, drive two late-model SUVs, have a large aboveground swimming pool, etc. My question is this: Am I a bad person for not wanting to babysit? My back and head hurt just thinking about the summer and beyond. Grounded Grandmother Grounded Grandmother: You are not a bad person for not wanting to babysit. You have the right to live the life you want to live. Loving your grandchildren and wanting to spend time with them should not obligate you to take full-time responsibility for them over the summer. Your grandson should be in a day camp during the summer. There are low-cost opportunities, which your daughter should research. The parents' job is to find stimulating activities to engage their son over the gaping yaw that is summertime. Camps, sports and summer programs will be better for him than hanging out with you and his toddler sister. You don't say what babysitting arrangements your daughter has in place for her youngest during the days you aren't there. Child care is the parents' responsibility, and you might offer to fill in the gaps or pitch in an emergency, but if you don't want to take on regular child care, you shouldn't. And you shouldn't have to justify your reasons. Your daughter is not going to like your refusal to provide regular child care. But you are going to have to train her to make other arrangements by starting to say \"no.\" Dear Amy: I was shocked to see such a one-sided group of letters extolling the virtues of parenthood in your usually evenhanded column. My husband and I are happily childless by choice. Procreating isn't the only way to find love, joy and meaning in life. Indeed, many would argue that the planet is already past its peak capacity to support human life. Many would agree that some people should not have children. All children should be wanted, loved and cared for appropriately. And even people who are financially and emotionally perfect for raising children should not be looked down upon if they choose not to. My husband and I consciously include young people and children in our lives through hosting international students and involving young family members and friends in our activities. And while some people with children do achieve MDs and PhDs while raising a family, it takes a toll on the children and adults. We chose not to do that. We are in our 70s, and our lives are truly complete. Jeannette Franks, PhD, and Richard Baker, M.D. Jeannette Franks, PhD, and Richard Baker, M.D.: Responding to a previous letter from a woman whose husband didn't want to have children, I asked for men to contact me regarding their own complicated feelings and fears about having children. Many men responded. As always, I chose to publish responses that represented the overall point of view. The men who contacted me expressed their own hesitations before having children, their struggles after having children and their happiness at their choice in retrospect. I'm very happy you also responded, to represent your completely valid choice not to have children, and your satisfaction and happiness regarding your own choice. I assume your point of view is also highly representative of other adults who are childless by choice. Dear Readers: Sometimes people who dispense advice run out of answers. If you've ever been curious about the life behind my advice, read my new book, \"Strangers Tend to Tell Me Things: A Memoir of Love, Loss, and Coming Home\" (2017, Hachette). 2017 by Amy Dickinson distributed by Tribune Content Agency",

                "Just don't let the mom make the older kid babysit in a few years. My friend had a neighbor like that. Boy was 12 or 13 and tasked with babysitting his 4 year old sister.  My friend had  kids around 3 or 4 and the boy took to dropping his sister on my friend's doorstep, ringing the bell, and running.", 
                "I am a firm believer in day camps for young children. My own daughter enjoyed an outdoor day camp where she learned to fish; climb trees; identify edible plants, animal tracks, and nests; make shelters, etc. They had a blast. Drop 'em off in the morning, pick 'em up in the early evening. Stick with kids mostly your own age and make friends along the way. Some kids don't like the outdoor stuff, there are game camps, history camps, library camps, science camps, museum camps, physical exercise (swimming, etc.) camps, karate camps, etc. The list is endless. For the love of god, please don't let the kid sit around all summer playing games on a tablet.", 
                "What's \"DFTT\"?", 
                "Yikes, why such defensiveness?  People have kids or they don't-if people question their lack of kids, it should clearly note that the issue is with the questioner, not the childless couple.  I don't have a PhD or a doctor's degree and even I know when something is not my issue but a projection from someone else.  Why all the justification about including kids, etc.  You don't have kids; didn't want them. That's it, any questions about it that are unwanted are an intrusion of privacy and should be warned off it a polite or not so polite manner depending on the circumstances.  \"I prefer not to discuss or justify our childlessness\" eg.", 
                "You said what I was going to say.  This would have been a perfect time for one person to choose to not be offended - everyone is so offended all of the time these days and it's getting pretty exhausting.\nWhat all people need to understand is that you will be judged by others and you don't have to pay attention to those judgments; you have a choice in whose opinion you care about.  People with children will be called breeders (and lord knows that if you have more kids than others think acceptable they'll be judged on that) and people who are childless will be judged.  Again, who freaking cares what other people think; be happy with the life you chose.", 
                "The problem is that a lot of people don't accept \"I prefer not to discuss or justify our childlessness\" and continue to press.  Or they go on about how you owe it to your family to carry on your genetics, or how parenthood is so ultimately rewarding that anything else you might ever possibly do will pale in comparison to that.  Some childfree people get the 3rd degree and judgement everywhere they turn, even (especially) from family.  It wears you down eventually, and you start getting defensive every time the subject comes up.", 
                "This is a response to the fact that Amy only published responses from men who were happy they had children. There was not one letter stating that a father regretted having children. And I don't believe for one minute that there is not a single father who regrets having children. As usual, Amy published the letters that supported her viewpoint. She is notorious for doing this type of thing.", 
                "As many people have pointed out, there are many options.  Summer camp + post-camp care by Grandma (for some reasonable fee like $15/hour), might be possible for the 9-year old, transportation permitting and Grandma approving.  I've been through those summer camp kid years, and the logistics are hard, and I was glad when they ended.  Baby-care is an issue that there is no easy solution for.  They would have saved  $30,000 - $40,000 by buying two cheaper cars, which is a decent amount to put towards daycare.", 
                "I must say, it never occurred to me to care what, if anything, people think of my procreational choice.\n\nOh, sure, I've occasionally run into people who smugly say \"If you had kids, you would know. . .\"  I just put 'em in the same box as people who think you can't have an opinion on foreign or military affairs if you've never served, or you can't know what real people are like if you don't live in one of the big square states.  You know, the idiot box.", 
                "And while some people with children do achieve MDs and PhDs while raising a family, it takes a toll on the children and adults. We chose not to do that.\n----\nThese people have a valid point regarding the responses to the letter in question (I say as a mother), but this sentence made my skin crawl.  They had the family they wanted, and others have the family they want.  To say that having a parent who is a doctor takes a \"toll\" on children is judging others in a way these people don't want to be judged themselves.", 
                "I think she meant that going to school to obtain advanced degrees while simultaneously raising children can be hard on the children.  I don't think she was trying to say that having educated parents is hard on children.", 
                "zI know the writer is talking about physician training. The comment remains judgmental and not even possible to prove, if not demonstrably untrue.  I work in academic medicine, and most of my co-workers have highly functioning, successful offspring.  No toll appears to have been taken.", 
                "On childless by choice:  my parents passed on an old saying \"I wouldn't take a million for you, but I wouldn't give a nickel for another just like ya!\"  Yep, been there felt that!  Especially when they were teenagers :-)", 
                "I'm sure others have said this already. Aside from the fact that the LW has no obligation to care for her daughter's kids if she doesn't want to, Daughter isn't thinking much of her young son. Leaving him with Grandma for a whole summer with nothing much to do is pretty awful. While Grandma could maybe be more creative than video games I certainly understand the difficulty of caring for a toddler and a 9 year old at the same time especially if you are older and not as energetic as you once were.  I'm a couple years younger than she is, in good health, and caring for a 14 month old for a couple of hours wore me out.", 
                "It is beyond obnoxious to expect that your parents will babysit your children for next to nothing. If you cannot afford childcare then you should not have children.", 
                "Apparently these people can afford childcare but demand it from grandma for a few pennies.", 
                "School-aged children really out to spend some time with their friends over the summer.  Day camp is good for this, but other options might be possible.  Maybe Grandma could host the grandson and a couple of his friends occasionally and families of the other boys could do the same.", 
                "This grandma-babysitting is something that I see so much of now--I agree with those that say Grandma should do the amount of babysitting she is comfortable with.  The one or two week grandma camp sounds like a great idea.", 
                "My wife and I are childless by chance. My wife never really wanted children and as circumstances turned out we didn't end up having any.\n\nWhile I have accepted our childless status the fact is that I will go to my grave never having experienced fatherhood. I admit that I have occassional twinges of regret because of this but don't dwell on it. \n\nMy wife and I have been involved in the lives of relatives' and close friends' children and have contributed money towards their college educations which we were more than happy to do. We enjoy being around children and listening to their perspective on life.\n\nThe one aspect of being childless that bothers me is the judgements we have endured from some parents who make comments that seem to indicate that our lives must be lacking because we are childless. On woman we know in particular has made some comments that we saw as designed to be hurtful towards us (as a result we have terminated our relationship with her). However, this one woman was pretty much the exception. \n\nWe have friends who have children and friends who are childless an so enjoy the company of each group equally.", 
                "People have no right to judge you.   I can understand that you might have some regrets, but as much as children can bring you joy, they also bring troubles sometimes.  It sounds to me like you are making the best of your situation.", 
                "Robert...........I wish I had words.  I have to admit I'm not a kid person because I don't want you to think being one affects what I'm going to say.  I am truly sorry that you did not have the opportunity to raise your own kid(s).  I consider that a huge loss for someone who, as I said in a previous post, has a burning desire to become a parent.  Let me also say, from your posts, I believe you would have been an *awesome* awesome Dad.  \n\nDid you ever let your friend know how her \"childless\" comments hurt you?  Or even how inappropriate they are to say to anyone at all?  We never know the circumstances of others' lives.  Commenting in such an ignorant manner is hard to understand.  The only thing I can come up with is that she is truly and completely self-absorbed and what she feels is law.  She's not capable of empathy or understanding or compassion.  I think you were wise to disconnect with her...she sounds like a shadow of a person.", 
                "If you can't afford children, do not have them.  It is just that simple.", 
                "No, it's not. Seemingly strong marriages end. Spouses die unexpectedly. Breadwinners are disabled. There are lots of reasons people might find themselves needing help raising their children.", 
                "Bull. CarlyO is correct. You should have finances in place before you have children. She did not say that something might happen to change those finances but you should start out being financially able to care for your own children without having to depend on grandma to babysit.", 
                "Nope.  If you want kids, you have to plan for everything to go wrong.  You buy insurance and you plan, and you are a fool if you leave the fate of your children up to your bad planning if the worst happens.  Sheesh....do you want to depend on people who don't really want to take care of your kids, saturdayschild?", 
                "I think it's time for those of us who didn't have children to cool it on the defensiveness. \n\nI'm not going to use the childfree or childless by choice label anymore. The first suggests how delightful it is to be free of children and the second defends against being pitied for infertility, and neither is entirely kind or sensitive to kids or those with fertility issues. And really, why see it as necessary to explain our feelings or our situation? \n\nI didn't want to have kids, and I didn't in fact have any. I'm happy with my decision, and with its outcome. (I'm also happy for those who wanted kids and have them, and sympathetic to those whose lives preempted their own preferences.) What anyone else thinks about my choice or my circumstance really doesn't matter, does it?", 
                "** The first suggests how delightful it is to be free of children**\n\nUm, it is delightful. I'm regularly, actively delighted about it.", 
                "I consider not having children to be delightful. But I don't need to be free of them, as though they're a pestilence or a mortgage.", 
                "Lw1 - You aren't a bad person to not want to babysit, your time is your time don't feel bad that you dont' want to spend an entire summer babysitting. \n\nThe only part of the post I didnt like was that she couldn't keep the 9 year old entertained. When did become the parents job to keep their kid entertained? I remember summer vacation at those ages. My parents didn't play with me or set up activities. I was out and about in the neighborhood doing what boys do, playing basketball, wandering around and getting dirty.", 
                "But that's the thing - kids aren't allowed to do that kind of stuff anymore. So it became the parents' job to micromanage and plan their kids' entertainment when parents started becoming irrational, fearful busybodies.", 
                "Glb, I so agre with you.  In my neighborhood, there are basketball hoops set up, great porches, trampolines and pools in the backyards, and I never see anyone using any of the outdoor attractions.  Never.  I guess the kids are so intent on their electronic devices that they almost babysit themselves.  \n\nI am still working, but I have already told my son and his girlfriend that I plan to enjoy my retirement.  You need to let your kids know that you don't want to be a babysitter before they even think about having kids.   They have to plan accordingly.", 
                "So was I.  But then I grew up on an army base and it was definitely a \"village\" atmosphere. But that was a different time and I would probably be jailed if I let a 9 year old go to the park alone. I'm not speaking hyperbole here. This has happened.", 
                "LW2-Amen.  Did not see the column where men shared w/Amy their complicated feelings about having kids.   \nAt any rate, having a burning desire to have children does not mean you're going to be glad you did or that you'll enjoy being a parent.  However, I wouldn't even entertain the notion of becoming a parent unless I wanted them so badly it hurt.", 
                "Oooh, an <i>aboveground</i> swimming pool? Aren't they fancy! I'll bet those SUVs even have luxurious cloth upholstery.", 
                "What's your gripe?  They have money to spend on \"toys\" and more expensive vehicles than what they need (both to purchase and to drive &amp; maintain), but they \"don't have the money\" to pay for child care during the day.",

                "Grandma needs no \"excuses\" for not wanting to spend her summer babysitting. Just the answer of \"no, I'm afraid I am not able to do that.\" She doesn't have to justify anything to them; she is retired and should be free to do whatever she wants to do - with no justification or explanation to the daughter. I couldn't imagine asking my mother to spend all of her summer babysitting my children when she had already raised 5 of her own. My decision to have them, my problem if I want/need to work and need babysitting. Emergencies only.", 
                "Aren't you the sophisticated, savvy one!", 
                "Several interesting statements from LW1.  First:  She clearly has no idea how much day care costs.   The payments even on two high-end SUVs wouldn't equal the amount of daycare. I wanted to be a SAHM, but my husband and I also couldn't afford daycare, especially not with two special needs kids.  If I had worked, all of my income would have gone to pay someone else to raise my kids.  Pretty pointless.  Second: Why do you need to act like a circus clown when the grandkids are over?  She clearly wasn't a SAHM, or she would know that you send the 9 year old outside, or SHE could pay for summer camp ..... OR she could let him sit and play on his iPad, get him some movies ... or whatever.  Since when are SAHMs circus performers??  Third: LOL sure she wants to volunteer.  True activists are the ones dragging their kids and grandkids along to help out.  And the community projects welcome them.  And Fourth (most importantly): It's clear that this grandma worked, her daughter was a latchkey kid, and the only validation she finds in doing anything is through getting paid.  So if she was getting paid like a regular babysitter, would that be okay??  Because it sounds like the answer would be \"yes.\"  She sounds like a pretty lost person who doesn't know what she wants to do with her life now that she's retired ... I've seen this a lot with my mom and her Boomer friends.  It's REALLY frustrating because they DON'T volunteer even to get out the house, because they think they're being taken advantage of.  And on the other hand, they also whine when they have to help out family.  The biggest irony?  THEIR parents, like my own grandparents, were active in their grandkids' lives.  I used to spend weeks at my grandma's when my mom was off doing whatever hobby she was into that year, but she most certainly has never passed on those favors to me or my kids.", 
                "Oh wow.  \n\nSo grandma is a \u201clost person who only cares about being paid\u201d because she doesn\u2019t want to contribute fulltime unpaid labor to her daughter\u2019s household budget?  Regardless of the price of SUVs that budget  should be configured to include daycare/summer camp costs for however many children they have.  The older boy is nine years old - what did they do previous summers?  They can do that again.  \n\nAlso, it\u2019s fine to say \u201ckick the kid outside\u201d but it shows a certain 50\u2019s mental template.  What are the chances that a 67 year old divorced woman/former single parent  can\u2019t afford a  house with a yard?  And how do you take an 18 month old on a volunteer opportunity?  (BTW as to the nine year old, bored kids usually have a way of spreading their discontent around...)\n\nBut really, lambasting her for making her child a \u201clatchkey kid\u201d?  How do you know her husband didn\u2019t just vanish one day leaving her to support the family?  Anyway, what\u2019s with the latchkey business?  I was a latchkey kid and it suited me fine.",

Don't want to turn people down, feel guilty and just can't wrap our heads around the fact that it is *OK*!!  \nAnd imo, *especially* in a situation like this where children are involved, one def needs to be honest.  I'm going to bet big time that this daughter knows very well her mom doesn't like taking care of her daughter very much let along both kids. And Amy's response was spot on.   \n\nDaughter is not considering anyone but herself.  Certainly not her kids.  And of course, her mother doesn't matter anymore, it seems. She's old and a grandmother! Of course, there's nothing else for her to do but babysit!  UGH.  \n\nThis woman is drained by kids.  I get it.  She wants to get out there and enjoy life mixing it up, doing whatever the hell she wants.  I believe she loves her grandkids dearly, but is just not the type of person who truly enjoys long-term interchange w/them.  Making herself available for emergencies is fine and will allow her some years to enjoy her life.  Daughter needs to be told and get used to this idea.  Believe me, I know that will not be easy for LW, but if daughter loves her mom and her kids, it will sink in.  \nI wish this LW the best.

I enjoy having a close relationship with him; helping my son and daughter in law and feeling useful although I am no longer a participant in the paid economy. That said every grandparent has the right to make that decision for themselves without feeling guilty.

That they would like to spend more time with their grandchildren because they didn't get that time with their own children or because they are used to being more busy (for lack of a better word).  I wonder if many SAHM moms opt out of caring for their grandchildren because they feel they've already dedicated 20 odd years to childrearing.

My husband makes a decent salary, but certainly not anywhere close to \"rich.\" I started teaching part time in the evenings when my son was 4 months old so that my husband was home when I was out. \nWe made it work. And yes, we drove used cars and didn't go on vacations, but I never felt that we were poor or making any kind of sacrifice. \nAs SnappyCat said: Life is about choices. \n\nMy only regret is that as I had my kids late--in my mid and late 30s--and it never occurred to me that I couldn't drop back into full time employment once the kids were more or less grown.

The other is just basically a saint/martyr/doormat type and I have no idea if she enjoys it a lot. Her whole life (I met her when she had preschoolers) has been  about ignoring her own needs desires (if any?) in favor of her husband/parents/kids needs. Now one of her kids has a high status job and travels a lot and so does the kid's spouse so she not only does daytime babysitting but several overnights a week.  To each his own. I'm a plane flight away from my grands and happily fly out to babysit for a couple days here and there when there's something going on. And of course when they visit or we visit them the parents are free to go shopping/ go out in the evening, whatever. \nI guess what I am saying is that I am pretty horrified by anyone feeling obligated.

The writers are 70, which puts the years of their child-raising peer group at a time when child care options were fewer. Child care centers were not regulated.. Reliable after-school programs were rare except in the most progressive of  cities and towns, and latchkey kids were not always ready to be home alone.  I'm certain she saw a great deal of stress among young moms around her. Child-care center regulations and after-school programs were a response to problems of working families of  the 1970s and early 1980s,\n\nGoing to grad school might not take a permanent toll on families depending upon the years and time involved, and the individuals, but we can't  ignore the many letters from  parents frazzled and at wit's end, marriages on edge,  from working and raising families and juggling housework while in post-graduate education or getting advanced degrees. Often these families are not well-to-do,  but are required by their professions or pressured by their employers  to earn an advanced degree in order to advance in their professions or keep their jobs. The toll may be greater in some families, with mom or dad behind closed doors weeknights and weekends working on papers and doing required reading, cranky and stressed,  Hours can be spent in lab work rather than at home, and it's a triple crisis when  parent is not only missing work to care for a sick child but missing an exam or work on a project. But why is the letter  about grad school anyhow? It's OK to choose to not have kids even if one is chooses to not attend college or grad school. Preventive birth control advances allow a couple the choice to not conceive.\n\nI, too, wish people would end their sensitivity over this issue.",

            "body": "President Trump nears the 100-day mark of his administration as the least popular chief executive in modern times, a president whose voters remain largely satisfied with his performance, but one whose base of support has not expanded since he took the oath of office, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. Trump's first months in office have produced some tangible successes. Beyond the continued enthusiasm of his most loyal supporters, a small majority of Americans see him as a strong leader. A bigger majority approves of his efforts to pressure U.S. companies to keep jobs in this country. Those who say the economy is getting better outnumber those who say it's getting worse by the biggest margin in 15 years in Post-ABC polling. But the president's balance sheet overall tilts toward the negative. Majorities of Americans say Trump has not accomplished much during his first months as president. Meanwhile, he shows little improvement on his temperament and honesty, and while he's gained ground on empathy, over 6 in 10 still say he does not understand the problems of people like them. [Read full poll results | How the poll was conducted] With a week remaining before his 100th day in office, Trump has yet to achieve a major legislative accomplishment, having been dealt a major setback when Republicans in Congress decided not to proceed with a vote on a health-care bill supported by the White House. His clearest achievement is the successful nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court seat previously held by conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Americans size up Trump's first 100 days in Post-ABC poll View Graphic Americans size up Trump's first 100 days in Post-ABC poll Executive actions on trade, immigration, climate and government organization have pointed the direction he wants to take the country, though his controversial proposed travel ban that affects a number of Muslim-majority nations remains blocked by the courts. Trump and others in his administration have attacked the courts, accusing them of overreach, but nearly 6 in 10 people see their actions as a legitimate role for the judicial branch. Overseas, he has demonstrated his willingness to use military force, with targeted strikes in Syria and the use of one of the biggest non-nuclear devices in the U.S. arsenal in Afghanistan. But tensions with North Korea remain high and the administration's policy in the Middle East remains cloudy. The 100-day marker is in part an artificial measuring post for any president, but by comparison, Trump has reached this point in his presidency faring worse to much worse than other recent presidents. An electorate that was deeply divided throughout the 2016 campaign remains so today, with opposition seemingly hardened and unyielding on most questions regarding his presidency. The president's approval rating stands at 42 percent, the lowest recorded at this stage of a presidency dating to Dwight Eisenhower. Trump's 53 percent disapproval rating is 14 percentage points higher than Bill Clinton's 39 percent disapproval in April 1993, the worst before Trump. Eight years ago, then-president Barack Obama's approval was 69 percent, his disapproval 26 percent. The Post-ABC poll finds 43 percent of Americans said they strongly disapprove of Trump's performance. That's also the worst by far of any president since George H.W. Bush by more than double. In the spring of 1993, 21 percent said they strongly disapproved of Clinton's performance. Americans split at 35 percent apiece on whether Trump is doing a better or worse job than expected, with the rest saying he's neither above nor below their expectations. There are no signs of major slippage in support among those who voted for Trump. His approval rating among those who cast ballots for him stands at 94 percent. Among Republicans, it is 84 percent. Asked of those who voted for him whether they regret doing so, 2 percent say they do, while 96 percent say supporting Trump was the right thing to do.When asked if they would vote for him again, 96 percent say they would, which is higher than the 85 percent of Hillary Clinton voters who say they would support her again. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) Trump is also satisfying the substantial share of the electorate that voted for him with some reservation. Among Trump voters who say they were \"somewhat enthusiastic\" or less excited about supporting him, 88 percent approve of his current performance and 79 percent say he understands the problems of people like them. Bill Clinton also had a rocky start to his presidency, which colored public judgments of his presidency by the 100-day mark. Although just 42 percent say Trump has accomplished either a great deal or a good amount so far, that is slightly higher than the 37 percent who said the same about Clinton in 1993. Similarly, judgments on whether campaign promises have been kept put Trump on about equal footing with Bill Clinton - 44 percent and 42 percent respectively. Also, Trump's 53 percent positive rating on strong leadership is almost identical to that of George W. Bush's at this point in his presidency, but much lower than Obama's 77 percent rating. Of those who say Trump has not accomplished much, 47 percent pin the blame on him while about a quarter blame congressional Republicans. Only 7 percent say Democrats are to blame. One of Trump's biggest deficiencies compared with other presidents is whether he is honest and trustworthy. Fewer than 4 in 10 (38 percent) say he is. At this point in their presidencies, 74 percent said Obama was honest, 62 percent said George W. Bush was honest and a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll showed 61 percent said Clinton was honest. Another gap is on the question of whether Trump can be trusted in a crisis. The poll finds that 43 percent - about the same as Trump's approval rating - say he can be trusted; 73 percent said so for Obama and 65 percent for George W. Bush at this point in their presidencies. On the specific question of how Trump has dealt with North Korea, 46 percent say he has been about right in his posture, 37 percent say he is too aggressive and just 7 percent say he is too cautious. On most questions about his performance or characteristics, Trump receives more negative than positive ratings. The most notable exception is his effort to pressure U.S. companies on the issues of keeping jobs at home, where 73 percent of Americans approve, including 54 percent of Democrats. Another issue where the public sides with Trump rather than his critics is whether it is a conflict of interest for Trump to spend time at his own properties. A 54 percent majority say he has the right to travel where he wants to go. But on another question, about 6 in 10 Americans say they disapprove of the major White House roles Trump has given to his daughter, Ivanka, and her husband Jared Kushner. Trump has net negative ratings on such questions as temperament - just as he did during the campaign - as well as on judgment to serve as president, and on whether he operates from a consistent set of principles. He has said he likes to be unpredictable. Half disapprove of the major changes he has proposed for government spending, while nearly 6 in 10 say he is out of touch with the concerns of most people. But on this question, the public is even harsher in judging the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. Democrats have lost considerable ground on this front. The 28 percent who say the party is in touch with concerns of most Americans is down from 48 percent in 2014 and the biggest drop is among self-identified Democrats, from 83 percent saying they are in touch to just 52 percent today. That is a reminder that whatever challenges Trump is having, Democrats, for all the energy apparent at the grass roots, have their own problems. The Post-ABC survey reveals a persistent gender gap, with women generally more negative toward the president than men, including double-digit gaps on Trump's attributes such as honesty and temperament. Just over one-third of women (35 percent) approve of the way he is handling the job of president compared with 48 percent of men. Even fewer women, 29 percent,say they approve of the changes he is proposing for government spending compared with 45 percent of men. Despite the public's skepticism of Trump's first 100 days, the survey finds little evidence voters would render a different verdict from last November, when Trump won key states needed to secure victory in the electoral college despite Clinton winning more votes nationwide. The new survey finds 46 percent saying they voted for Clinton and 43 percent for Trump, similar to her two-point national vote margin. Asked how they would vote if the election were held today, 43 say they would support Trump and 40 percent say Clinton. The Post-ABC poll was conducted April 17-20 among a random national sample of 1,004 adults interviewed on cellular and landline phones. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. Emily Guskin contributed to this report.",

            "body": "(Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) EMEK SHILOH, West Bank - Nachum Schwartz cautiously eyed the rugged landscape where he hopes to build his new home.   \"You see here, where there are thorns? That means no one ever lived or worked here and there is nothing written down about any ownership,\" he said.  The point is especially potent to Schwartz, who two months ago was forced out of his home of 20 years in the West Bank outpost of Amona. The settlement was bulldozed in February after it came to light that it was built on land owned by Palestinian farmers living nearby. The government has proposed resettling the families on a site just outside the Jewish settlement of Shvut Rachel, to what would be the first new Jewish settlement in 20 years. But it remains unclear when, or even if, the new settlement will be built. A multitude of obstacles stands in the way, such as bureaucratic complications, Palestinian claims to the land and international pressure. Schwartz said the families, most of whom are now living in crowded school dormitories in the nearby settlement of Ofra, need an \"immediate solution.\"   [Israel set to approve first new settlement in 20 years] \"We need somewhere to live now, and we want to stay together as a community,\" he said. And the location must have ideological meaning.  \"Shiloh is the cradle of the nation of Israel. This is where our roots are,\" Schwartz said, adding that he still dreams of returning to the hilltop where Amona stood.  That location, about a -20-minute drive south of here, was deemed by Israel's Supreme Court to belong to farmers from the Palestinian village of Silwad. After a decade-long battle with the court and the government, the residents were forced to move, their homes and farms demolished.   Children of Israel's Amona settlers play in a common area of a hostel in Ofra in the West Bank on April 9. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) Schwartz was one of the founders of Amona 20 years ago. He met his wife there, he had his seven children there and raised a herd of sheep on the land there.   \"The sheep are totally messed up\" by the lack of a routine, he said. \"It's all very strange for us. But life goes on, and we are going to build something new.\"  The Israeli government's approval on March 30 to build a new settlement was widely condemned by much of the international community and viewed by the Palestinians as another Israeli attempt to take over their land.   The Obama administration had considered the settlements an obstacle to peace. President Trump has refrained from directly criticizing the new settlement. But after Israel's announcement, an official speaking on the condition of anonymity told The Washington Post that \"while the existence of settlements is not in itself an impediment to peace, further unrestrained settlement activity does not help advance peace.\" In a White House meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in February, Trump said Israel should \"hold back on settlements.\" Since then, the president has indicated his intentions to restart the stalled peace process between Israelis and Palestinians.   But Palestinian opposition to the very existence of settlements, let alone a new one, could make kick-starting a peace process that much harder.  \"Israel continues to destroy the prospects of peace in our region and to severely affect our lives by the theft of land and natural resources, and by the further fragmentation of our country,\" said Saeb Erekat, secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization.  Erekat said that the settlements violate international law and that Palestinians \"are not going to accept any formula that aims at legitimizing the presence of Israeli colonies on occupied Palestinian land.\" An Israeli man and children who had settled in Amona are now staying at a hostel in Ofra in the West Bank. (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) After approving the new settlement, Netanyahu tweeted that it was his way of keeping a vow he made to the evicted Amona settlers, who say God promised the land to the Jews. Netanyahu -relies heavily on support from the roughly 400,000 Jewish settlers living in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, not including East Jerusalem, which is also considered occupied under international law. What Netanyahu did not mention is that the new settlement is slated for an area far from the blocks of West Bank Jewish communities that would most likely remain part of Israel under any peace agreement. If a Palestinian state is created, the new settlement and others around it would have to be removed. \"It's not just the land. The real question is how many more settlers are going to be living there,\" Frank Lowenstein, a former special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, said after the announcement. \"How many more settlers will they have to figure out how to remove or compensate in the context of a peace deal? Creating a new settlement just makes the problem significantly worse.\"    But the former residents of Amona say the situation could not get much worse.   Tamar Nizri, her husband and seven of her eight children have been living in two cramped rooms on the second floor of the Ofra youth hostel since Feb. 2.   The paper-thin walls do little to keep out the noise of her neighbors, who are also from Amona. The only place to sit is on her bed, and the children - ages 5 to 17 - sleep in the next room on three sets of bunk beds.  \"It's very stressful here,\" she said as her children came in and out of the room. \"But if we leave, then the government and everyone else will forget about us.\"   Israeli settler Tamar Nizri, 38, with her 5-year-old daughter, Noa. Nizri, her husband and seven of her eight children have been living in two cramped rooms on the second floor of the Ofra youth hostel since Feb. 2 after they were moved from the Amona settlement.  (Linda Davidson/The Washington Post) Nizri moved to Amona at 19. Married and with her first child, she said the issue of legal vs. illegal never occurred to her. There were shrubs, rocks and not much more, she said.   \"The government gave us electricity, and we thought it would all be all right. We had been raised on stories of other settlements where they built and got the permits later,\" she said. Her husband planted grapevines and opened a winery where he produces wines named after each of their children.   \"Even after the court ruling two years ago, it still did not hit us that all we had built would be destroyed,\" she said.   On demolition day, Nizri -allowed dozens of the hundreds of Israeli youths who had turned out to protest the evictions to sleep in her home. When police and soldiers arrived the next day to remove the residents, the youths chained themselves to one another and to the house.  \"My house became a symbol of people of Israel. Their presence gave me strength, and I did not want them to leave,\" Nizri said.   \"I have a connection to the land, just like the Palestinians,\" she said. \"This land was promised to our forefathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. We were forced out 2,000 years ago, and now we are back.\"  Nizri said she goes back to visit the place where her old home once stood.   \"For us, it was more than a house, it was a home,\" she said. \"In 20 minutes, 20 years of our life was just destroyed.\"     Read more: The little NGO that managed to move an Israeli settlement Israel passes bill to seize private Palestinian land for Jewish settlements Today's coverage from Post correspondents around the world Like Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news",

(Etienne Laurent/EPA) PARIS - For a few days over the past two years, terrorism helped to unite some parts of French society. Following large-scale attacks, the French rallied behind their deeply unpopular President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, making his approval ratings repeatedly skyrocket for short time periods. But the times of political unity are long over. In Sunday's first round of the presidential election, following a divisive campaign, French voters will have their choice between 11 candidates and their vastly different approaches to counterterrorism. Even before Thursday's attack at the Champs-Elysees in which one police officer was killed, a majority of French said in polls that they wanted harsher sentences for terrorists and more powers for security services to prevent attacks. Sunday's vote is the first presidential election since the wave of terrorist attacks in France started in early 2015, and two of the four leading candidates are in favor of counterterrorism laws that have been criticized as draconic. Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen and conservative contender Fran\u00e7ois Fillon have vowed to introduce sweeping legislation to expand police powers if they get elected. Centrist contender Emmanuel Macron's proposal to increase security measures also attempts to calm the fears of voters, although it remains far less extensive. Tougher measures might not automatically lead to more safety in France, however. Experts are warning that the opposite could be the case. In reality, a further crackdown on terrorism in the way it has been practiced so far, they say, could end up exposing the country further and making it more vulnerable to attacks.

(Charles Platiau/Reuters) \"Invasive counterterrorist operations and tough tactics by the general police have [already] led to alienation in some sections of the community and may be contributing to the increasing problem of jihadist radicalization in France,\" said terrorism researcher Frank Foley. Several purportedly arbitrary arrests in counterterrorism raids have created a perception that all Muslims are now under a general suspicion in the country. A Le Pen victory in particular might \"lead to a dangerous escalation of the situation in France,\" Foley said. Le Pen has, for example, vowed to proceed with large-scale deportations of Islamists. And following Thursday's attack, both she and Fillon stated that France was \"at war\" with radical Islam. Some say that such harsh rhetoric has only incited sectarian tensions. \"Le Pen's recent remarks deliver a representation of Islam, which could easily be perceived as incompatible with secular democracy and indirectly play into the hands of radicals,\" said Dounia Mahlouly, a terrorism scholar with the International Center for the Study of Radicalization. The Islamic State and other groups have been trying to isolate Muslims within Western societies for some time to make them more prone to radicalization. Hence, a Le Pen win - and a further marginalization of Muslims - could also be a victory for the Islamic State's recruitment strategy. But to many voters, this is the kind of tough talk they think is needed to tackle the continual terrorism threat. Marine Le Pen, at a National Front rally in Frejus, France, on Sept. 18. (Jean-Paul Pelissier/Reuters) Contrary to Le Pen's proposal to reinstate border checks and to intensify a police crackdown on extremists, observers in neighboring Britain and Germany believe that a complete rethink of French counterterrorism is needed. \"Before the current wave of terrorism ... France already had one the most hard-hitting counterterrorism policies in Europe. They have simply reinforced that approach since the attacks of 2015,\" said Foley, who said the effect had been minimal. First put in place following the November 2015 attacks in Paris, France's state of emergency has been extended five times. Lawmakers justified the latest extension last December by arguing that authorities had foiled at least 13 attacks within the preceding six months and that the threat level remained extremely high. In an indication of growing discomfort with the measures, human rights groups have recently voiced sharp criticism of the emergency rules which allow police to place anyone under house arrest who is deemed a security threat and to search houses without judicial warrants. Although Foley and others acknowledge that the extensive measures may have prevented some attacks, they say that France is pursuing a dangerous path. Britain, for instance, has chosen a radically different counterterrorism strategy, which relies far less on police powers and more on preventive approaches to stop the radicalization of extremists in the early stages. Much effort has been put on improving relations between police forces and local Muslims in Britain - an approach which has recently gained traction in France within the current Socialist government and was also embraced by centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron. The only leading candidate who wants to roll back some security measures is leftist politician Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. Despite his pledges to reverse the marginalization of Muslims in the country, he is aware of the limits of such an approach if he wants to win the election. On Saturday, one unofficial election poster urging Parisians to vote for him hung next to the Bataclan - the nightclub which was targeted in November 2015 by Islamic State militants who entered Europe using refugee routes. \"Refugees welcome,\" the poster read. During these days in France, it is a message few would agree with. Leftist candidate M\u00e9lenchon himself has said France's strict immigration policies will be unlikely to change.

(Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters) Climate change is more than melting ice caps and swamped islands. The environmental effects of climate change - droughts, floods and severe weather, for instance - have increasingly put more people on the move. In 2015, the U.N. Refugee Agency counted 65.3 million people around the world as \"forcibly displaced,\" including about 40 million within their home countries. Wars, ethnic conflicts, economic stresses, famines and disasters are among the reasons people leave their homes. Less understood, perhaps, is how climate-induced environmental changes - such as increased flooding, salinization, droughts or desertification - amplify these drivers of migration. What are the policy options to help people stay in place or minimize the security concerns related to migration? These questions are becoming more and more important to figure out. Climate change and conflict To look at these issues in depth, the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University convened a working group on human migration and climate change. ISD's April 2017 report, \"New Challenges to Human Security: Environmental Change and Human Mobility,\" brings together analysis and discussion from experts on climate change, resource management, migration, foreign policy and national security, and included government and nongovernmental organization policymakers and foreign policy practitioners. [The Trump administration can't entirely roll back progress on climate change. Here's why.] The report provided a number of guiding principles for policymakers. Here are five key findings: 1) Environmental migration poses significant human security challenges. Local and regional tensions over water problems are likely to rise sharply in the coming decades, according to a 2012 U.S. National Intelligence Council (NIC) report on water security. The U.S. government designated climate change a national security issue a decade ago. Over the next 20 years, a 2016 NIC report warns, increasing numbers of countries may be overwhelmed or destabilized by climate-related stresses such as famines, weather-related disasters or resource shortages. In 2015, for instance, a tropical cyclone hit Yemen - the first in the country's recorded history - dropping several years' worth of rain in a single day. The flooding heightened political tensions in a country \"already suffering a humanitarian crisis from war and water shortage,\" according to the NIC. These are not isolated incidents. We see conflicts over water and land resources growing in Mexico, Syria, Nigeria, Mauritania, Somalia, Mali, Vietnam and many other countries - along with parts of the U.S. Southwest. [How climate change makes the world more violent] 2) Extreme weather events are likely to displace more people. The 2014 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) cautions that most communities are unprepared for cyclones, storm surges and other climate-related extremes, which can cause \"disruption of food production and water supply damages to infrastructure and settlements.\" Whether these events cause short- or long-term displacement of people, the likelihood is that more people will be on the move in the decades ahead. 3) Many displaced people head to nearby cities, and that's a problem. The ongoing urban population explosion means coastal cities will continue to grow. But many of these cities probably already feel the brunt of many of the same environmental problems driving people from their homes - water and other shortages, increased salinization or rising sea levels, for instance. Figuring out the \"pull\" mechanisms to direct people where their needs can be met is a policy priority, as is job creation. An added challenge is the rising trend of \"urbanization without growth\" - when new jobs or economic growth fail to keep up with the influx of new residents, leaving environmental migrants few work options. 4) We don't adequately define \"environmental migrants.\" Those who relocate within their own nations rely on the protections and assistance of their government. But how do we identify and protect those who cross national borders in search of safety from environmental harm? These definitions are important for a host of legal, economic and security reasons. Not all environmental migrants are \"refugees\" - a term that confers specific legal rights and protections. 5) \"Planned relocations\" will become more frequent. From the coastlines of Alaska and Louisiana to growing numbers of Pacific island nations, communities are already preparing to relocate as rising sea levels wash away their homes and leave the land too salty to support crops or livestock. These are highly complex and expensive moves and require much planning. The island nation of Kiribati, for instance, is negotiating with Australia and New Zealand to take some of its population, and Kiribati has already purchased part of an island in neighboring Fiji. None of these challenges has an easy fix, but many governments, international organizations and communities are looking at ways to boost the resiliency of communities at risk from climate change, as well as facing the reality that climate change will displace millions more in the coming decades. In 2015, for instance, more than 100 governments pledged to support the Nansen Initiative, a Swiss-Norwegian plan to bring about greater global collaboration to protect people displaced by climate change and disasters. With the numbers of displaced people rising, there's a lot to discuss - and a lot of lives at stake. Kelly M.

                "This article seems to want to tie several different scientific questions into a single bundle, which is a fundamental error in argument.\n#1 - Climate Change: It can be demonstrated, both scientifically and statistically, that the climate has been warming for the last 400 years, at least. In fact, the physics of this change has been understood now for about 100 years.\n\n#2 - Climate Change is a Man-Made Phenomena: Though not as conclusively agreed upon as the existence of climate change, the data appears pretty solid. Though carbon produced by human activity accounts for about 4% of all carbon released into the atmosphere, the type of carbon that appears to be collecting in larger and larger amounts (I believe it is referred to as \"C-14\") is produced by  the burning of combustion engines and other human activities. If the collection of carbon in the atmosphere is the primary cause of a change in the climate, then the argument that our activity has had, at the very least, a significant impact holds up.\n\n#3 - Climate Change is a Global Catastrophe: There is no consensus on the level of change the earth will have to endure. It may very well be a nightmare. It may not.\n\n#4 - Human efforts applied today will forestall any man-made climate change from occurring: There is less consensus for this than for any of the other arguments. While there are several scientifically legitimate models that indicate climate change is a reality, not one of them indicates that the climate change that is occurring can be stopped or stalled. \n\nI know that there are fanatics who demand that we all believe, or disbelieve, something or the other.

            "body": "President Trump repeatedly emphasized the importance of the first 100 days of his potential presidency while on the campaign trail. All of these clips were filmed between Oct. 24 and Nov. 6, 2016. (Gillian Brockell/The Washington Post) President Trump is nearing 100 days without a victory. By way of explanation, he has pointed his Twitter trigger finger at the media, at Democrats in Congress, at conservative House Republicans - at pretty much everyone but himself. The Republican House Freedom Caucus was able to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. After so many bad years they were ready for a win! - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017 The Democrats will make a deal with me on healthcare as soon as ObamaCare folds - not long. Do not worry, we are in very good shape! - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017 No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days, & it has been a lot (including S.C.), media will kill! - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2017 But maybe Trump should hold up a mirror. More than half of Americans think Trump hasn't accomplished much in his first 100 days (56 percent). Of those less-than-impressed Americans, almost half blame the president for getting so little done, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. (Numbers do not add up to 100 because not everyone polled had an opinion.) Given how rarely Trump expresses humility or regret, acknowledging that he's got a learning curve could help buy him a grace period. Assigning blame elsewhere just doesn't seem to be working for him. A caveat to this data: It's nearly impossible to separate the blame game from partisanship. Democrats are more likely than others to say Trump has not accomplished much. And only those who doubted Trump's accomplishments were asked who is most responsible. Most Republicans and Trump voters think he has accomplished a good amount. Also, blaming the president for inaction 100 days in is not unusual. In the first three months of President Barack Obama's term, 49 percent of Americans who thought he struggled to get anything done shouldered him with the blame. (Though they split it 40-40 between President Bill Clinton and Republicans in Congress during Clinton's first 100 days.) (Numbers do not add up to 100 because not everyone polled had an opinion.) But Trump perhaps has more to prove than his predecessors. To have a successful presidency, he must make good on his central campaign pitch that someone with no previous political experience can govern the nation better than the politicians. So far, he hasn't been very convincing. His approval ratings are the lowest of any modern president's three months in. His leverage with Congress appears to be little to none. The Post-ABC poll found that a majority of Americans also criticize Trump's temperament, judgment, empathy and honesty - and they don't trust him in a crisis. Trump, in short, is having a crisis of confidence. And that's why turning to himself when assigning blame for these first 100 days may be so crucial for him to regain his footing. A dose of humility could go a long way, perhaps, if he addressed Americans like this: \"Hey guys, I know we've failed to get Obamacare repealed and that my travel ban is stuck in the courts again. But I'm new to this. Give me another 100 days.\" This Post-ABC poll has data points that suggest Americans might be ready to hear him out. A majority think Trump is a strong leader. (The percentage is far lower than Obama's, but it's something.)   In addition, hardly any of Trump's supporters have buyer's remorse. Republicans polled think Trump is more in touch with them than the rest of the Republican Party is. In other words: Trump's job approval may be taking a hit, but not among his supporters. They still have faith that his business skills will translate to politics. The rest of America isn't so sure, and Trump's habit of assigning blame elsewhere doesn't seem to be assuaging their concerns.

                "Not to put too fine a point on it, but Trump and his blinded supporters are dumber than a fence post. He has only one interest: himself. His ridiculous border wall isn't even wanted by the states adjacent to the border. He wants to slice and dice federal programs that have real and positive impact on real people. He wants to cut the ACA because it was a campaign promise. And every other word out of the mouths of his spokespeople refers to the end of his eight years. People are angry! This self-centered clown will be lucky to make it to the end of his current term, and it's highly unlikely there will be a second term in his future.", 
                "The latest tactic by the Conservatives seems to be to paint anyone that disagrees with them as anti-free speech. This whole Ann Coulter SHAM is a way of trying to push this. They want to paint basically ALL American  colleges and universities as anti-free speech and calling for them to have a voice.  It's bizarre in it's misleading nature. They supposedly are incensed about not having free speech on college campususes, but they want to FORCE their will upon these colleges to get their way.  \n\nYoung Republican's may be in the minority on many college campuses, but if they think they can force people to believe something they don't want, they are being total hypocrites. They are screaming about their freedom of speech rights being infringed, but they want to infringe on the rights of others in order to have a voice. You can't force people to believe something which they don't believe.   The whole thing is a FARCE. And in addition, we are no longer supposed to call these ignorant Trump supports DUMB.  Good luck with that. \n\nThey're trying to turn the tables, but they are pulling a scam and it's very transparent.  If you want to be in the majority on a college campus, pick such a campus. Liberty University would be glad to welcome you and continue with their own agenda.",

            "body": "Luigi Di Maio of the Five Star Movement at a news conference in Rome on March 23. (Alessandro Bianchi/Reuters) MILAN - When people think of racism and xenophobia in Italy, what comes to mind is usually prejudice toward Arabs, Africans and other easily identifiable minorities. But Romanians have become one of the major targets of xenophobic abuse here - despite the fact that the two countries are both European Union members that have similar languages and cultures. A high-profile example of that prejudice occurred earlier in April, when a prominent Italian politician falsely accused Romania of exporting almost half of its criminals to Italy, then blamed the European Union for making it possible. \"Italy has imported 40 percent of [their] criminals from Romania. While Romania is importing from Italy our firms and our capital. What an amazing deal the EU is!,\" wrote Luigi Di Maio, the vice president of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Italy's parliament, and one of the leading representatives of the populist Five Star Movement, in a controversial Facebook post. There are currently 1.3 million Romanians living in Italy, making them the largest group of foreign nationals in the country and 22 percent of the total immigrant population. Romanians are drawn by the similarities between their language and Italian and, since Romania joined the EU in 2007, the fact that they don't need a permit to stay. Di Maio's anti-Romanian statement was baseless. In fact, as blogger Luca Sofri has documented, he was distorting statistics issued in 2009 by Romania's then-justice minister, which showed that 40 percent of fugitive criminals sought by Romanian authorities were hiding in Italy. But the accusation conforms with widespread prejudice in Italy against immigrants from Eastern Europe. And that resentment, which is increasingly intertwined with opposition to the E.U., has become a hot-button issue in Italian politics. The conservative newspaper Il Giornale, usually critical of M5S, has praised Di Maio for having \"told the truth, for once.\" \"There is this idea that Romanian men are all thieves and Romanian women are all prostitutes,\" said Ana Maria Crainic, a Romanian woman married to an Italian man. The couple now lives in Timisoara, Romania, where Crainic works as a manager, but they used to live in the northern Italian city of Padua. \"All these prejudices are one of the reasons I don't want to go back to Italy,\" she explained. Di Maio is the Five Star Movement's likely candidate for prime minister in the next general election, which is due in 2018 but could be held earlier. The Five Star Movement, or M5S, is the leading party in opinion polls, having surpassed the ruling Democratic Party. Manlio Di Stefano, an M5S member of the parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee who was authorized to speak on the party's behalf, told The Post via email that Di Maio's statement does not \"preclude [good] relations with the Romanian population, and in particular with those residing in Italy.\" Di Stefano added that his party supports the idea that \"every EU citizen is free to come in Italy, either for tourism or in order to work, as long as they respect the national legal system.\" Mihai Mircea Butcovan, a Romanian writer living in the Milan area, said hostility toward Romanians is widespread in Italy and that politicians - regardless of party affiliation - often use that hostility to curry favor with voters. \"I would have never imagined this amount of xenophobia when I moved here in the 1990s, but I guess racism is cyclical,\" said Butcovan in a telephone interview. \"Twenty years ago, the primary target were the Albanians, then it was the Moroccans. Now I guess it's our turn.\" The Northern League, a xenophobic right-wing party, has campaigned for years against Romanians. But the Five Star Movement, which has vowed to call a referendum on leaving the euro (though not the E.U. entirely) has only occasionally descended into openly xenophobic rhetoric. The fact that the party is now targeting Romanians may signal how intertwined anti-immigrant and anti-E.U. sentiments have become. It wouldn't be the first time euroskeptics have boosted popularity for their agenda by stoking resentment against Eastern European immigrants. \"People tend to forget that in 2005 the referendum for the European constitution was rejected in France because of the hysteria over the 'Polish plumber,'\" noted Anna Zafesova, a Russian journalist living in Milan who works for the newspaper La Stampa, referring to a stereotype of Eastern Europeans supposedly stealing low-wage jobs. Ahead of the Brexit referendum in Britain last year, the Leave campaign was also fueled by warnings about Romanian and Bulgarian immigrants. Butcovan said he believes attitudes toward Romanians began deteriorating between 2005, when Romania's E.U. membership was agreed, and 2007, when it became effective. But he says he doesn't believe there is a direct correlation between anti-E.U. sentiment and prejudice against his people. Instead, he mostly blames the media for spreading the perception that Romanians are criminals. Yet others say the fears of prejudice are overblown. Simona Olteanu, a Romanian woman working as a housekeeper in the Tuscan town of Forte dei Marmi, said she has never experienced racism in her everyday life. \"It's something that one comes across more on Facebook or with politics,\" she said. \"I try just not to watch the news.\" Read more: Italy may require asylum seekers to do community service E.U. nations pull welcome mats for migrants, imposing new restrictions",

There is currently a debate in Norway about the outdoors areas and parks where the children used to play that are now closed due to the itinerant Gypsies using them as outdoor toilets.  Feces and trash is everywhere, left behind by the Gypsy beggars.\n\nBesides, there is a saying in Europe that after one shakes hands with a \"Romanian,\" one should count one's fingers.",

According to some history books, the name Romania was given by the Roman Empire after they took over Dacia in about (the original name of Romania), books suggesting the meaning of this name was 'the big Rome'. Romanian language is of  latin origins and there are lots of similarities with the Italian language. There are lots of gypsies in the Eastern Europe, as during their history, they were travelers and they were oppressed in the western world, so in order to get away from persecution, they have moved in EE.

A significant number of Roma pop up as the ubiquitous \"gypsy beggars,\" petty thieves, and gangs of street kids quick to surround naive tourists, and that colors the impression many western Europeans have about Romanians writ large. Of course, the Roma are just as abhorred in Romania itself, and blamed by many (probably most) Romanians for the negative attitude west Europeans have toward Romania, the country's inability to get into Schengen, etc.  In any case--  this is kind of like reading an article about the \"porous Texas-Mexico\" border without a single reference to drug trafficking.",

            "body": "It was a cold December morning in 2015, and Roger was slowly dying. With end-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), he had been in and out of the hospital for months, each episode worse than the last. Once able to walk to his favorite corner store with an oxygen tank, Roger had morphed into a gaunt skeleton, tethered to his bed by entangling tubes and masks. Time was precious as death closed in, and Roger was wasting it in a lonely, restrictive hospital room. \"He's not going to hospice,\" my nurse practitioner told me during inpatient rounds. \"We talked to him, and he didn't want to hear any of it.\" \"Let me try,\" I offered. \"Best of luck,\" she said with a sigh. \"He's not the easiest to talk to.\" \"I know,\" I said, taking a deep breath. \"I know him from before.\" Then I went to talk to Roger - my patient, my friend. The first time we met Roger - to protect his privacy, I'm identifying him by his first name only - and I met during my first year as a medical student at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, on the first day of the school's Seniors as Mentors Program. For four years, students were paired with patients 65 and older who volunteered to teach us about medicine from a patient's perspective. They allowed us to accompany them to doctor's visits, explore their health in the home and get to know them outside the hospital setting. It promised to be a memorable relationship, and I was excited to see what my patient mentor would be like. [How I discovered and important question a doctor should ask a patient] I waded through the hectic meeting hall, filled with a sea of very old patients and very young medical students, to find Roger, barely older than 65, with salt-and-pepper hair and a portable oxygen tank. After 40 years of smoking, he had lost one lung to cancer while the other succumbed to severe emphysema. Through pursed lips and wheezes escaping from his diseased airways, he offered a labored \"hello\" as we shook hands. Roger possessed an odd combination of traits: He was extremely intelligent, with great attention to detail, but he was also eccentric in a way that could be off-putting. He would impress me with his extensive knowledge of Thailand, my home country, but in the next breath he would call me \"Oriental,\" an outdated phrase that made me feel like a physical object from the East. When Roger told me that he did not have many friends and that he was estranged from his brother, the only family he had left, I partly understood why. Sometimes at doctor's appointments, his obsession with detail and his social oddities would unfold into awkward arguments with doctors about the minute particulars of various treatment plans. I struggled to clearly define my relationship with him. Because of his age and his off-putting quirks, I did not think of Roger as a friend, and because I was not his doctor, I did not think of him as a patient. It would not be until years later, after I had patients of my own, that I truly understood the gravity of my medical school experience with him. The man who loved Go Several years later at Mount Sinai, I was finishing up a fellowship in geriatrics when an attending physician flagged me down in our clinic. \"Hey, I think you know one of my patients,\" the physician said. \"You took a really detailed social history of him a few years ago.\" [A terminally ill woman had one rule at her end-of-life party: No crying] That patient was Roger. At the physician's request, we looked at Roger's medical chart together and discussed his case before going in to see him. Having read many impersonal, uninformative patient records by that point, I was reminded of how insightful a medical history can be when it is written by someone who really knows the patient. In my student notes, I'd written down the names of Roger's parents and where he was born. I'd told a story of how he grew up in the Presbyterian Church and how his skepticism of it led him to become an atheist. I'd even gone into great detail about how Roger played Go, a Chinese board game, probably because I liked the game myself and we used to have long conversations about it. Years of stories came flooding back through the notes, and I remembered Roger. I remembered him despite the long white beard he'd grown and the bald spots where his salt-and-pepper hair used to be. He remembered me, too, even with a new haircut and a long white coat. A different kind of friendship Soon after I happened upon Roger in the clinic, his COPD began to worsen, and he started coming to the hospital frequently. During the first visit, he recovered well enough to return home. But after a few admissions, it was clear that his body was failing him, and the likelihood of Roger returning to the walk-up apartment where he lived alone was getting slim. As fate would have it, I got to be one of the doctors who took care of Roger during these admissions. Of all the health professionals on his team, I was the only person who had a chance to visit Roger at home. No one but me knew how Roger navigated the oxygen tubing covering his apartment floor, and I began to recognize the significance of getting to know patients beyond the incomplete picture we saw in the hospital. To effectively provide care for someone, it's important to learn who they are, what they eat, how they breathe. [When should I start thinking about hospice care, for myself or a loved one?] Being able to visit patients in their homes was the first stage in building this crucial understanding, and this was true for Roger as it was for other patients I had visited at home. However, with Roger, I was able to take the second step of building a relationship with him over the years, and this bond would prove helpful to our medical team during Roger's inpatient stay. Because he often grew skeptical when discussing treatment details with unfamiliar providers, I became the designated communicator for the team. Telling a friend he is dying When it was clear that Roger's remaining lung was quickly deteriorating, I went to tell my friend that he was dying. I walked into his room with my usual greeting, trying in vain to convince myself that this conversation would be the same as delivering bad news to any other patient. We talked about the weather, and I asked permission to discuss the medical updates of the day. When I told him his lung was getting worse, he said he knew. \"What's next?\" he asked. I took a deep breath to brace myself for what was next. \"I can't imagine how hard this must be for you to hear, because this is extremely difficult for me to say.\" I reached for his hand and grabbed it. \"Since we've known each other for so many years . . . \" Roger squeezed my hand, and I started to sob uncontrollably. My last shred of composure gave way to waves of overwhelming sorrow. It was hard to tell my friend that he was dying, that I could not save him. \"How long?\" Roger asked. I could hear the trepidation in his voice. \"Less than six months,\" I answered, my voice shaken by guilt and the feeling of failure. \"I think I've heard enough for today,\" he said after a long silence. \"But I'm glad you're the one who came to tell me.\" The road to hospice By that cold December morning in 2015, about a week after I told Roger he was dying, a few providers had offered hospice to him, unsuccessfully. Understanding what was important to him, I knew that Roger would pick hospice if he could get past his mistrust and concerns over the details. Here was my chance to help guide Roger through one of the most important decisions of his life, and I did not want to fail. \"I know I can't fix your lungs,\" I started, cautiously choosing my words, \"but I am going to make sure that you are always comfortable, no matter what happens.\" He nodded calmly. I pressed on: \"I want to make sure that you will always have help when breathing becomes more difficult, and the best place to keep you comfortable is at inpatient hospice.\" I paused for his reaction. \"Okay,\" Roger answered, his reply slow and contemplative. \"What you're saying makes sense.\" I could sense him letting down his guard, relinquishing the skepticism he had toward unfamiliar providers in prior hospice conversations. With relief, sadness, hope - all embedded in a single question - he asked, \"Where is inpatient hospice?\" I squeezed his hands. Roger was ready. Innovations in care With a growing number of physicians working in shifts and a greater demand on them to work in specialized fields, patient care is increasingly fragmented, involving multiple handoffs with multiple doctors. In a 2010 survey, 1,035 American adults reported seeing an average of 18.7 doctors during their lives. The numbers were even higher for poorer and older adults (who reported seeing 22.4 and 28.4 doctors, respectively). With more handoffs, the therapeutic relationship gets weakened, for both the patient and the provider. According to a 2009 Archives of Internal Medicine article, 75 percent of patients in a Chicago hospital could not name a single physician in charge of their care. When patients refuse to repeat the story of why they came into the hospital for yet another new provider, I empathize with them. As a geriatrics fellow in the hospital, I usually see patients after they have already talked to emergency medicine residents, emergency medicine attending physicians, surgical consultants, night-float residents, internal medicine residents, medical students, a handful of nurses and numerous patient care associates. When patients appear skeptical after hearing our recommendations, I empathize with them, too. I'd also be skeptical if I didn't know the name of the person recommending the next major step in my care. After following Roger for many years, a few times into his home, I knew Roger beyond his COPD, and he knew me beyond my white coat. Understanding how he made decisions, I presented Roger with a single treatment choice that was in line with his values. When listening to my medical recommendations, Roger not only had the advantage of knowing my name, he also had gotten to know me outside the hospital doors and developed a kind of trust from our years of friendship. For physicians, the ability to learn about our patients' lives beyond the traditional care settings is invaluable, and yet our ability to connect with them on a meaningful level is challenged constantly. In medical school, we are taught to apply the same script to every patient, regardless of who they are: Start every visit by asking about the chief complaint, describe every patient beginning with their age and sex. In clinics, visits are becoming shorter to achieve higher productivity, and billing and chart documentation leave barely any time for meaningful conversations. As we struggle to provide continuity of care despite multiple handoffs, to re-create the joy of medicine amid increasing burnout and to promote a patient-centered approach to health care, the answer to accomplishing all three may lie in encouraging longitudinal relationships built equally in the health-care setting and in the patient's home. This can begin, as it did in my case, during medical training. A number of U.S. medical schools offer senior mentor programs similar to the one I participated in. Such programs should be expanded to include patients of all ages and should be offered to physicians and nonphysician health professionals alike. In real-world practice, home visits should be encouraged because they can provide tremendous information on patients' lives outside the hospital. Once the provider-patient bond develops, our health-care system must provide an infrastructure to ensure that this bond can flourish and support patients across all care settings. During transitions or hospital admissions, care should always be coordinated with a designated provider, someone on the patient's care team who has established trust and understanding of the patient over a longitudinal relationship. The last handoff On another cold morning later in the month, I met up with Ben, the hospice liaison, to ensure a smooth care transition for Roger. We discussed the details of his care, and I told Ben everything I knew about the man who loved Go. \"Your name carried a lot of weight with him,\" Ben said. \"You must have known each other a long time.\" \"Since I was a medical student,\" I answered, as fond memories came rushing back. \"I'm glad I got to take care of him. He doesn't really have a friend to advocate for him.\" \"Well, he does,\" Ben replied. \"You are his friend.\" Sangarlangkarn is the chief of the Center for Healthy Aging at Samitivej Srinakarin Hospital in Bangkok.

In my youth, we moved every four years or so, but in each place we lived, our doctor (the same one for our whole family) also became a family friend. He made house calls, and he and his family also had meals with us, from time to time. There never any doubt that we could trust the doctor, or that the doctor would fail to appreciate our needs, our personalities, our circumstances. But that was 60 years ago.", 
                "As a nurse who started in health care at the age of 17 as a CNA, I can only morn the passing of the health care system that gave us physicians who take time with their patients. Today, Doctors are judged-not on their skills and abilities-but on how many patients they can see per hour. Extra time at the bedside showing compassion, encouraging someone to attend AA, or getting a diagnosis correct doesn't matter in the assembly line of today's Emergency Room - or other places. Physicians who don't see the required number per shift are eased out in favor of those who can't intubate and lean on senior nurses for help with critical pediatric or patients they don't have experience with. Their one asset? They see patients quickly. This is what corporate medicine has given us.",

But when the time came and we were called to say to come quickly, we were in Biloxi, Mississippi.\n\nSo I asked her attendant to please hold my mother's hand and comfort her as she lay dying.\n\nMy mother's ashes sit in the foyer of our house.

                "I only wish that more doctors had more time to get to know their patients and really explain their conditions and treatment plans.  As a neuroscientist, I find that almost anytime I tell someone what I do for a living, they immediately start telling me about some neurological condition that they, or a loved one, are dealing with and start asking me questions.  They are not asking for medical advice because they know that I am not that kind of doctor.  Their questions are much more basic.  What is this condition really? What causes it?  Why is the doctor doing what he/she is doing?   At the most basic level, what they want to know is: Am I doing the right things? Am I asking the right questions? Am I doing enough? Is this my fault?  There is a lot of anxiety for both patients and family members that is caused by a sense of helplessness.  They are putting their lives, or the lives of their loved ones in the hands of a virtual stranger with no idea whether or not they are doing the right thing.", 
                "Wonderful story and very moving, yet my pessimism and cynic perspective keep nagging me back to the idea that this special moment is a one-off from reality, where most will die alone, forgotten and neglected until they are no more.\nI just don't see modern business models allowing for this unless the patient is very wealthy with excellent coverage, and for the friend and doctor, even more impossible on any scale of relevance.\nBut I did enjoy reading another tale of the last remaining vestiges of civilization.",

My 68 year old sister just died of end stage COPD she also had emphysema, Parkinson's, dementia, and neuropathy and she was an alcoholic. Unfortunately she and my brother-in-law were able to keep her drinking problem from her doctors for years. I guess her falling continuously for the last almost 2 years they blamed on her Parkinson's  and not the mixing of alcohol and medications she took. At least she died unexpectedly but peacefully at home after 2 falls broke her leg and 2 ribs. She spent much of her last 2 years in and out of the hospital with the doctors wondering why she was passing out so often. Why they never figured out her falls had to do with her drinking is a mystery to me but when too many doctors are in the mix I think that can ruin good care since nobody seemed to know what the other doctors were doing. Roger was lucky he had someone who cared.",

Of the people who died at home, the hospice nurses were there at least once a day, and sometimes two and three times a day, depending on my friends' condition.\n\nrhonda may want to die in the hospital, and if that's what she wants, fine.

Yes, we did the majority of the caring particularly at night - yet for those things we couldn't do, there was always a hospice volunteer that could come in and do whatever it was.  Further, what was beneficial about hospice was that we knew we had backup - particularly with pain relief.  Since none of my siblings or my father had ever dealt with the level of pain relief required - we really didn't know how deal with this situation to make my mother comfortable - it was a blessing to know that experts were only a phone call away.

Newer therapies, including possibly marijuana and its derivatives, must overcome opposition often based on ideology rather than reason and evidence. And, then, there are all the problems related to incredible price increases for drugs, controversy over generic and bio-equivalent medications, antibiotic drug resistance, widespread fear of preventive therapies such as immunization, and demands that patients be free to \"opt out\" of basic health programs for their children. An article just yesterday described how Idaho even allows parents to withhold essential medical treatment from their children if they have \"deeply held religious beliefs,\" even unto the death of the child. It is both messy and complicated; tragic and exciting. Gotta love and salute those who are struggling to move this situation forward."

            "body": "Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff for Georgia's 6th Congressional District special election speaks during a rally in Roswell, Ga., on April 17.  (Kevin D. Liles/Reuters) Jon Ossoff, a 30-year-old novice candidate, gave the Democratic Party a much-needed lift, winning 48 percent of the vote in the Georgia 6th Congressional District special election. Ossoff can claim credit for a huge swing in the 9.5+ Republican district from 2016, when Tom Price held his seat without breaking a sweat. Ossoff exhibited no small amount of poise in running right at the president, lamenting his boorish and erratic behavior. When President Trump lashed out at him, he calmly rebuffed the tweet. \"While I'm glad the President is interested in the race, he is misinformed,\" said Ossoff. \"I'm focused on bringing fresh leadership, accountability, and bipartisan problem solving to Washington to cut wasteful spending and grow metro Atlanta's economy into the Silicon Valley of the South.\" Ossoff came out looking like the more presidential of the two - by a long shot. Ossoff even brought Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to heel. On Wednesday, Sanders threw cold water on Ossoff's candidacy. \"I don't know [if he is progressive]. Some Democrats are progressive, and some Democrats are not,\" said the independent, who never bothered to register in the party whose nomination he sought. That rankled party members, who publicly accused Sanders of being unhelpful. By the week's end, Sanders was furiously back-pedaling. \"Let me be very clear,\" Sanders said in statement. \"It is imperative that Jon Ossoff be elected congressman from Georgia's 6th District and that Democrats take back the U.S. House. I applaud the energy and grassroots activism in Jon's campaign. His victory would be an important step forward in fighting back against Trump's reactionary agenda.\" In short, Ossoff beat 17 other candidates, stymied Trump, forced Sanders to be a team player and showed Democrats that a new generation of articulate, forward-looking progressives without years of political experience may lead them out of the political wilderness. For all that, we can say, well done, Mr. Ossoff.",

                "Ossoff is not the first Democrat to win the \"award\".  Every so often a Democrat does show up.  I think that Diane Feinstein won once and one or two other Senators  and Representatives have also picked up the \"award\".  \n\nPresident Obama never did win the \"award\" although he certainly should have for the beautiful speech he made in Selma.",

                "\"It's imperative .....that Democrats take back the U.S.  House.\"  ---- Bernie\n\nWell of course,  but I don't see how that can happen as long as Republicans hold onto their upper hand\nwith gerrymandering.", 
                "At least the gerrymandering Repubs in Texas have had a couple of judicial smackdowns this past month in Texas. Several district maps will be redrawn. The 2018 elections in Texas should be interesting.", 
                "Ossoff still has a big hill to climb in this district where Republicans are firmly in charge.  His opponent, Karen Handel, was Georgia's Secretary of State until she resigned in 2009 to run for Governor.  Her record as Secretary of State was uninspiring unless you favor working assiduously to remove eligible voters from the rolls. I expect Ossoff to make as much of that as he can, but he has to be careful. Lots of 6th District Republicans and so-called Independents are more than comfortable with seeing fewer African-American, Asian and/or Hispanic voters going to the polls, and they are not too concerned about the illegality of that.", 
                "That overt racism is shameful. It does appear in general that younger people are more comfortable with our increasingly diverse population. Perhaps Ossoff will bring out more of those younger voters to help change the face of politics in the 6th.", 
                "Maybe the much needed and sought after \"new faces\" in the Democrat party is beginning to emerge and make their positions clear.\nLet's hope so not only for the candidates but for the party which is struggling to regain relevance and momentum.\nThe Democrat party desperately needs new blood, thinking and direction,  not by 100 pages disregarded autopsies, or resurrecting the old guard  but by a strong infusion  and support  for clear independent party movers and shakers.", 
                "Jengazi continues trending left, but those in the know realize this is all because Bibi cut her loose and she cannot continue to parade as a hard-right Neocon, what with so many of them already in the WAPO stable.  She's a crafty old witch.", 
                "Jennifer Rubin strikes me as a sincere and talented journalist.  It is good to see her work evolve in these dire times for our democracy.", 
                "The ideological distance between Tom Price and Jon Ossoff covers almost the whole political spectrum.  Quite a switcheroo.", 
                "I'm not so sure about that.  I think that Ossoff, while progressive on some issues is more of a moderate on other issues.\n\nPrice was hard right, of course, and Ossoff certainly doesn't reach the other end of the spectrum like a Bernie Sanders or, even worse, a Dennis Kucinich."

            "body": "This \"2017 Remix\" edition of one of Stillwater's staple beers is dry-hopped with Nelson Sauvin and Simcoe hops. The bright, fun can is new, too. (Fritz Hahn/The Washington Post) A beer, like pop music, is never really a finished product, even after it has been released to and enjoyed by the masses. If a brewer decides to tweak the hop bill or use a different malt, he or she can toy with these elements while still keeping the essence of the beer, the same way that a producer or DJ can release remixes of a the latest chart-topper. Brian Strumke, the man behind Stillwater Artisanal Ales, is open to taking a fresh look at his most established brands: He has made \"Amazonian Remixes\" of Cellar Door and Stateside saisons, adding tropical Brazilian fruits; Lower Dens, a saison inspired by the music of the Baltimore band Lower Dens, also was released in a \"Remastered\" version with brettanomyces added. This spring, Strumke is taking aim at Stateside Saison, one of his first beers, with a new \"2017 Remastered\" edition. It's dry-hopped with Nelson Sauvin and Simcoe, and has an attractive new retro can design to boot. [Dank and resinous, this is the 4/20 beer you've been searching for] This is still one of the better saisons around, shot through with lemon grass, floral notes, citrus and a touch of honey. There's a noticeably earthy, grassy funk and bitterness to the finish that I don't remember from the previous version, with extra tartness and sweet fruit. The can looks like it was designed for summer cookouts, but Stateside isn't quite a beach beer - while delicious and refreshing, it's a little heavy, and at 6.8 percent alcohol by volume, a bit stronger than most beers designed to be crushed in the sun. Stillwater Stateside Saison. stillwater-artisanal.com. About $10 for a four-pack of 16-ounce cans. If you like this, try another hoppy saison: 3 Stars Citra Lemon Saison . Slightly tart and loaded with lemon, this D.C. saison finishes with a dry bitterness. Boulevard Tank 7 . Boulevard's flagship saison is full of spice and bright citrus, with a crisp, earthy hoppy character. Prairie Standard . A light, easy-drinking farmhouse ale from Oklahoma. Like Stateside, it's dry-hopped with New Zealand hops - in this case, Motueka.

            "body": "One Saturday afternoon this month a band gathered to jam at the Dominican House of Studies, not far from the Catholic University of America. The drummer, a Dominican friar, counted them down. Brother Brad Elliott, dressed in a habit behind his drum kit, was joined by Sister Miriam Holzman on the piano. Sister Peter Grace Weber was off to the side, with a bass guitar. Sister Louis Marie Zogg, on the saxophone, stood next to Sister Mary Andr\u00e9 Thelen, on the trumpet. As the session continued, Brother Brad bopped his head, grinning. The sisters kept giggling as they worked out timing and tempo and little blips. There was joy in the room, and what they played. Which was not church music. The band played \"Unforgettable\" and \"What a Wonderful World,\" because sweet jams are not just for the secular. (Sarah Larimer/The Washington Post) Sisters Miriam, Louis Marie, Peter Grace and Mary Andr\u00e9 are members of Force of Habit, a band led by nuns who live and study at Catholic University. The band is rounded out by Brother Brad and Father Jude DeAngelo, the university chaplain and director of campus ministry, on vocals. And, actually, they're not bad. \"It shows that we have completely natural, normal, human personalities,\" Brother Brad said. \"And we don't really cease being human beings when we put on the habit. We don't cease to be normal and lovers of fun and music when we put on the habit. The habit is just a different aspect of who we are.\" The sisters, and those who know them, note that the band is part of a larger mission - to be a presence on the campus, connect with other students, and share and demonstrate their faith. It also serves as a reminder of what makes Catholic University, the Vatican's university in the United States, unique. \"It sort of started out as something that we could do for the students, to show them that we love them, that we want to be a part of their community,\" Sister Louis Marie said. \"But then it's also just fun for us, as a group of sisters, to be able to share that and have fun together.\" Before Force of Habit, the sisters had a singing group called Nun of the Above. (These nuns, it seems, like to pun.) That morphed into a band in August. \"I knew that the sisters had musical talent, and I thought that with the inclusion of Brother Brad on the drums and Father Jude as a lead singer, that it would be a great way for us to participate on campus,\" said Sister Miriam, who grew up in Saskatchewan, Canada. The band has performed at four campus events this academic year, developing a bit of a following at the private university of about 7,000 students in Northeast Washington. \"I am like, one of Force of Habit's biggest fans. I love Force of Habit,\" said Amanda Martin, a freshman. \"There is something incredibly funny about four religious sisters in a blues band. They're really good.\" Martin, 18, a theology and religious studies major from Lancaster, Pa., was such a groupie that she designed and sold band T-shirts. She thinks of the sisters as friends, she said, so of course she'd try to support them. \"And when you watch them perform with Brother Brad, who is the drummer, and one of our priests, Father Jude, who sings for them, they're always just smiling and having a good time. They just love doing it,\" Martin said. \"They take it seriously but they do it for fun, they do it to play and be good. They're just so fun to watch; they really are.\" The sisters, who range in age from 25 to 35, belong to the Dominican Sisters of Mary, Mother of the Eucharist, which has its Motherhouse in Ann Arbor, Mich. All four are part of Catholic's religious-in-residence program and are students with plans to graduate in May. Sisters Miriam and Louis Marie are working toward master's degrees in philosophy, while Sisters Peter Grace and Mary Andr\u00e9 are earning master's degrees in secondary English education. Sister Miriam's mother arranges the band's music. Sister Peter Grace, who grew up in Grand Rapids, Mich., learned the bass guitar for Force of Habit. Sister Miriam taught her. Sister Louis Marie, who grew up in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, started playing the saxophone in fifth grade, but didn't really think a band would be a part of her life as a nun. (\"It was clearly like, divine providence,\" she said.) Sister Mary Andr\u00e9, who is from Ann Arbor, also picked up the trumpet in the fifth grade, but stopped playing in high school. After she entered the convent, though, she said she started playing again. \"I think it's good for [students] to see that when we enter the convent, that our whole selves become for God,\" Sister Miriam said, when asked what students got out of seeing sisters in nontraditional roles. \"It's not a repression of yourself, but that you're really freed in the religious life to be who you are and to give of yourself. I think that they see that we're free and that we're happy.\" While at Catholic, the sisters eat in the campus dining hall, say their prayers in campus chapels and live in residence halls with students. Clare Whitton, 21, a resident assistant in one of the dorms where they live, says she often sees the sisters grabbing coffee with students, who trust their opinions. She called the bunch \"some of the most free and truly happy women\" she's ever met. \"I think that happiness shows in the way that they engage and the way that they don't hesitate,\" said Whitton, of Hopewell Junction, N.Y. \"They are not ashamed of the way that they live. They are not ashamed of their faith. I think that I wish that the rest of the world could view them in such a loving way as I do now.\" On Palm Sunday, the sisters could be found near the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, playing ultimate with other students before they headed off for prayers. The sisters leapt for the disc without hesi-ta-tion and played solid defense. Yes, they did it all in habits. \"They're just fun, because the first thing they tell you is 'Okay, please don't bowl us over, go easy on us, we're the sisters,' \" said 20-year-old Madelyn Demaret, a sophomore from Elk Grove Village, Ill. \"But if they're up in the air for a disc, no mercy, man.\" Sister Peter Grace Weber of the Dominican Sisters of Mary, Mother of the Eucharist, outruns fellow students during a game of ultimate on the campus of the Catholic University in Washington.

(Charles Platiau/Reuters) PARIS - The U.S. elections last November were preceded by a divisive campaign, overshadowed by government investigations, allegations of Russian meddling and an underestimated anger at the establishment that helped a candidate gain momentum while using social media to speak directly to his supporters. Surprising or not, all of this could also be said about Sunday's French presidential election. [Charles de Gaulle would roll over in his grave over what has become of French politics] Although French politics is vastly distinct from the mechanisms of Washington, there are some remarkable parallels between both nations' election campaigns that indicate that some of the factors that are shaping U.S. voter sentiment can also be found in Europe. Anti-establishment sentiments Three of the four politicians who are best positioned to win the French presidency do not want to be associated with mainstream politics, an indication of how skeptical French voters have become of what they consider to be the political establishment. Trump's victory over his Republican rivals and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was perceived to be part of a similar trend. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly called for \"draining the swamp,\" referring to the political establishment in Washington. [What you need to know about the French election] Ironically, French voters' desire to elect an outsider has elevated candidates who spent decades as part of the establishment. Leading candidates Emmanuel Macron and Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon were career politicians of established parties before founding their own movements. Nevertheless, their popularity could have a profound long-term impact on French society. Since the early 1980s, all French presidents have come from either the mainstream conservative or Socialist party. But that might change this year, upending the country's de facto \"two-party system.\" Social-media campaigning Never has social media played such a role in French election campaigns. On the phone with @BarackObama. pic.twitter.com/2dYHLismdh - Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) April 20, 2017 Whereas all candidates have been using Twitter or Facebook - centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron recently posted a photo of himself speaking to former U.S. president Barack Obama - it is far-leftist contender Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon who would probably win the award for most innovative social-media campaigning. A hologram of French Left party leader and presidential candidate Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon speaks to supporters in southeastern France on Tuesday. (Laurent Cipriani/Associated Press) Once a candidate with almost no chance of winning, M\u00e9lenchon has managed to spread his leftist message with such success that he now has about twice as many supporters as the candidate of France's traditional Socialist party, Beno\u00eet Hamon. M\u00e9lenchon even appeared as a Hologram at various locations so that he could address supporters in multiple cities at the same time. His use of such a showy effect to gain the greatest possible attention while campaigning reminded many French people of Trump's ability to draw and captivate large audiences across the United States. [Against all odds, a leftist soars in French election polls] But to some voters, M\u00e9lenchon's Americanized campaign was more awkward than inspirational. \"M\u00e9lenchon's hologram idea was really just a halfhearted attempt to appeal to millennials,\" said 24-year-old Sam Dickson, a student who was attending a dinner gala at the French university Sciences Po Paris on Friday night. \"It really only made him appear ridiculous.\" The Russia factor Several presidential candidates in France have faced questions about their ties to the Russian government. Contrary to the accusations the Trump campaign is facing over possible links to Russia, the cozy relationship between far-right candidate Marine Le Pen and Russian President Vladimir Putin is no secret. During a meeting with Putin in March, Le Pen said she was inspired by Putin's \"patriotic economic policy.\" French media have also accused conservative party candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon of financial links between his campaign and the Russian government, allegations that Fillon disputes. [French election could bring a jolt to Western security, no matter who wins] Both candidates have said they want to improve relations with Russia, and both have received support from the Kremlin. \"Russia's official media have been supporting Le Pen and Fillon for months,\" said C\u00e9cile Vaissi\u00e9, a Russia expert at the University of Rennes in northern France. \"They have done everything they could to create the impression that there is a huge immigration problem in Europe and in France, and that France is in decadence because of gay marriages.\" Marine Le Pen, leader of the French National Front, is running for president. (Marlene Awaad/Bloomberg News) Ongoing investigations When the FBI announced that it would investigate newly discovered emails related to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton days before the November presidential election, it was widely perceived as a setback for the Democratic candidate and a potentially decisive factor in the election's outcome. [What to watch for in the first round of the French presidential election] In France, criminal investigations have also had an impact on opinion polls. After conservative party contender Fillon was placed under investigation March 14 on suspicion of embezzling and misusing public funds, he dropped in the polls and has since been competing for third place with far-leftist candidate M\u00e9lenchon. Le Pen has also seen her popularity decline after she was accused of misusing European Union funds. It is unclear how much Le Pen's and Fillon's decline in popularity has been driven by the ongoing investigations. But the debate over the investigations' impact on public opinion has striking similarities to claims in the United States that the FBI's investigations might have been responsible for Clinton's defeat. As in Clinton's case, supporters of Fillon and Le Pen contend that the allegations of misconduct are politically motivated. More-centrist or leftist voters, however, argue that the investigations are a sign that French democracy is working.",

            "body": "Acute shortages of home health aides and nursing assistants are cropping up across the country, threatening care for people with serious disabilities and vulnerable older adults. In Wisconsin, nursing homes have denied admission to thousands of patients over the past year because they lack essential staff, according to associations of facilities that provide long-term care. In New York, patients in rural areas have been injured, soiled themselves and gone without meals because paid caregivers aren't available, according to testimony provided to state legislators in February. In Illinois, the independence of people with severe developmental disabilities is being compromised as agencies experience severe staff shortages, according to a court monitor overseeing a federal consent decree. The emerging crisis is driven by low wages - around $10 an hour, mostly funded by state Medicaid programs - and a shrinking pool of workers willing to perform this physically and emotionally demanding work: helping people get into and out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, eat and participate in routine activities, often while dealing with challenging behaviors. [New rules give nursing home residents more power] Experts warn that this labor problem portends even worse difficulties as America's senior population swells to 88 million people in 2050, up from 48 million today, and requires more assistance with chronic health conditions and disabilities. \"If we don't turn this around, things are only going to get worse,\" said David Gifford, senior vice president of quality and regulatory affairs for the American Health Care Association, which represents nursing homes. \"For me as a parent, the instability of this system is terrifying,\" said Cheryl Dougan of Bethlehem, Pa., whose profoundly disabled son, Renzo, suffered cardiac arrest nearly 19 years ago at age 14 and receives round-the-clock care from paid caregivers. \"We've gone through hundreds of . . . workers, and there have been times I've found Renzo sitting in a recliner, soaking wet, because his diapers hadn't been changed. And at times I wasn't sure if he was being fed well or treated well,\" Dougan continued. \"It's exhausting, mentally and physically. You live with a constant sense of crisis.\" Rising demand For years, experts have predicted that a rapidly aging population's demand for services would outstrip the capacity of what is called the \"direct care\" workforce: personal care aides, home health aides and nursing assistants. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that an additional 1.1 million workers of this kind will be needed by 2024 - a 26 percent increase over 2014. Yet the population of people who tend to fill these jobs, overwhelmingly women age 25 to 64, will increase at a much slower rate. After the recession of 2008-2009, positions in Medicaid-funded home health agencies, nursing homes and community service agencies were relatively easy to fill for several years. But the improving economy has led workers to pursue higher-paying alternatives - in retail services, for example - and turnover rates have soared. At the same time, wages for nursing assistants, home health aides and personal care aides have stagnated, making recruitment difficult. The average hourly rate nationally is $10.11 - a few cents lower than a decade ago, according to PHI, an organization that studies the direct-care workforce. There is a push on now in a handful of states to raise the minimum to $15 an hour. For-profit franchises that offer services to seniors who pay out of pocket are also having problems with staffing. \"All the experienced workers are already placed with families. They're off the market,\" said Carrie Bianco, owner of Always Best Care Senior Services of Torrance, Calif., part of a national chain with franchises in 30 states. Finding new employees was so difficult that Bianco started her own 14-week training program for caregivers nine months ago. To attract recruits, she ran ads targeting women who had left the workforce or had been close to their grandparents. In exchange for free tuition, graduates must agree to start working for her agency. \"There's much more competition now - a lot of franchises have opened and people will approach our workers outside our building or in the lobby and ask if they want to come work for them,\" said Karen Kulp, president of Home Care Associates of Philadelphia. Hardest to cover in Kulp's area are people with disabilities and older adults who live at some distance from the city center and need only one to two hours of help a day. \"These people are not necessarily getting service,\" she said, because workers prefer longer shifts and less time traveling between clients, so they gravitate to other opportunities. It's unclear how common these problems are. Neither states nor the federal government routinely collect information about staff vacancy rates, turnover rates and people going without services offered by home care agencies and nursing homes. \"If we really want to understand what's needed to address workforce shortages, we need better data,\" said Robert Espinoza, vice president of policy at PHI. Some of the best data comes from Wisconsin, where long-term-care facilities and agencies serving seniors and people with disabilities have surveyed their members over the past year. Hard times in Wisconsin The findings are startling. One of seven caregiving positions in Wisconsin nursing homes and group homes were unfilled, one survey discovered; 70 percent of administrators reported a lack of qualified job applicants. As a result, 18 percent of long-term-care facilities had to limit admissions, declining care to more than 5,300 vulnerable people. (Altogether, more than 87,000 people live in 4,102 nursing homes and residential care facilities in the state.) \"The words 'unprecedented' and 'desperate' come to mind,\" said John Sauer, president and chief executive of LeadingAge Wisconsin, which represents not-for-profit long-term-care institutions. \"In my 28 years in the business, this is the most challenging workforce situation I've seen.\" Sauer and others blame inadequate payments from Medicaid - which funds about two-thirds of nursing homes' business - for the bind. In rural areas, especially, operators are at the breaking point. \"We are very seriously considering closing our nursing facility so it doesn't drive the whole corporation out of business,\" said Greg Loeser, chief executive of Iola Living Assistance, which offers skilled nursing, assisted living and independent living services in a rural area about 70 miles west of Green Bay. Like other short-staffed operators, he has had to ask employees to work overtime and use staff from temporary agencies, increasing labor costs substantially. A nearby state veterans home, the largest in Wisconsin, pays higher wages, making it hard for him to find employees. Last year, Iola's losses on Medicaid-funded residents skyrocketed to $631,000 - an \"unsustainable amount,\" Loeser said. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) has proposed a 2 percent Medicaid rate increase forlong-term-care facilities and personal care agencies for each of the next two years, but that won't be enough to make a substantial difference, Loeser and other experts say. The situation is equally grim for Wisconsin agencies that send personal care workers into people's homes. According to a separate survey in 2016, 85 percent of agencies said they didn't have enough staff to cover all shifts, and 43 percent reported not filling shifts at least seven times a month. Barbara Vedder, 67, of Madison, has witnessed the impact firsthand. Paralyzed from her chest down since a spinal cord injury in 1981, she qualifies for 8.75 hours of help a day, while her husband tends to her in the evening. \"It's getting much, much, much more difficult to find willing, capable people to help me,\" she said. \"It's a revolving door: People come for a couple of months, maybe, then they find a better job or they get pregnant or they move out of state. It's an endless state of not knowing what's going to happen next - will somebody be around to help me tomorrow? Next month?\" When caregivers don't show up or shifts are cut back or canceled, \"I don't get proper cleaning around my catheter or in my groin area,\" Vedder continued. \"I'll skip a meal or wait several hours to take a pill. I won't get my range-of-motion exercises, or my wheelchair cushion might slip out of place and I'll start getting sore. Basically, I start losing my health.\" Debra Ramacher and her husband have been unable to find paid caregivers since June 2015 for their daughter Maya, 20, and their son Michael, 19, both of whom have cerebral palsy, epilepsy and other significant disabilities. The family lives in New Richmond, about 45 minutes from the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. \"At least three agencies told me they've stopped trying to hire personal care aides. They can't find anybody, and it costs them money to advertise,\" said Ramacher, executive director of Wisconsin Family Ties, an organization for families with children with emotional, behavioral and mental disorders. \"It's incredibly stressful on all of us, living with this kind of uncertainty,\" she said. Every few months, Ramacher tries to find caregivers on her own by putting ads up on Craigslist, in local newspapers and on job boards. \"We get a few bites,\" she said. \"Most recently, two people came and interviewed. One never got back to us; the other got a better job that paid more.\" In the meantime, she and her husband are being paid by Medicaid to look after Maya and Michael. \"We don't want to be the caregivers; we want to have our own life,\" Ramacher said. \"But we don't have any option.\" - Kaiser Health News Kaiser Health News is a national health policy news service that is part of the nonpartisan Henry J.

This is not a new problem\u2014it\u2019s been true for years-- and yes we should pay aides more.  Education? Yes but probably the best education comes from people who have done it. It's demanding work. I have lived in Maine all my life --oldest state or 2nd oldest and I see the incredible work people do for nothing. In many areas especially rural ones transportation is a huge issue.  Trying fixing your old car on $10/hour.\nMedicaid should mandate doubling the pay in every state. AARP should do way more aggressive advocacy instead of pretending aging is all rainbows and white water rafting.  \nAnd most important our society needs to value the vulnerable and voiceless more.

                "The reality is that institutionalization and dependence on paid home aides will not work in the long run.  That is the obvious conclusion that anyone who has actually been involved will realize.  We need to completely change our focus and approach.  (1) We need to offer a LOT more telework jobs so that home caregivers can work from home. (2) We need a LOT more training of home caregivers, especially male home caregivers who have to increasingly roll up their sleeves and take charge.  (3) We need Alzheimer's Association and others who do good work to STOP emphasizing institutionalizing everyone.  That is a long-term disaster.  (4) As part of the home training, we need real, specific, not \"glittering generality\" guidance, for home caregivers that is detailed, specific, organized, and web accessible, because those people are not coming in to \"meetings,\" (5) We need industries that recognize these needs and come up with more products and solutions to help home caregivers.

                "I'm really surprised at the tenor of many of these comments, to the effect that families need to step up and provide care or that we should legalize assisted suicide so the physically fragile can \"off\" themselves.\n\n1)  As a social worker with older adults in NYC for the last 25 years, I can tell you that most families do step up.  While it is true that people have needed help since time immemorial, medical advances now enable more people to live longer and with more disability than in the past.  It is simply beyond the capability of most family members to provide 100% of the care needed for the length of time a disability can last.  \n\n2)  Research with older and disabled people reveals that even if they appear to you to have low \"quality of life,\" they value their lives as much as you do yours. With age and disability, your world can get smaller but that doesn't mean your life is without meaning.  Older people and those with disabilities are not going to jump off a cliff or take advantage of assisted suicide in order to reduce your tax burden.\n\n3) It has never been the case that families always took care of all of those in need.  Not even when \"Leave It To Beaver\" was the TV role model.  People with physical and emotional disabilities without family care (for whatever reason) were cruelly warehoused until this universal need was recognized and addressed.  If you have a family who can care for you for 30 years of disability, congratulations.  Every day I and my colleagues encounter \"unfamilied\" older adults and older people who are themselves caring for disabled children with no one to take their place when they become ill or die. These people did not somehow \"fail\" because they are in this situation. \n\n4)  I was a thin, non-smoking vegetarian work-out freak when I had a heart attach at age 47.  I'm healthy now but every single member of my family pre-deceased me (parents and siblings).  If I need care in the future, in what way is that a failure on my part?", 
                "Thank you for your well written comments.", 
                "You are absolutely correct.  However, the reality is, like it or not, that more families will have to do home caregiving than they ever did in the past.  There simply won't be any choice.  That day is not far off, and it will be less traumatic if we simply recognize that reality and plan for it.  That won't solve the problem of those without families, but it will reduce the problem for those with families.", 
                "When you pay caregivers enough so they can pay all of their bills every month, you will see people applying for these very unpleasant jobs.  Until then, good luck.

The problem of caring for the elderly who are no longer able to care for themselves Is going to increase as we work our way through the hump of the post WW2 \"baby boom\".\n\nThis kind of care requires an army of extraordinary people with special skills but also great compassion and mental stability. At times the job can be a full scale assault on one's own personal equilibrium and this is made worse if it is an underpaid job and a thankless job.\n\nI'm not trying to be provocative, but I have noticed, in hospitals and elsewhere the marvelous contribution of immigrants in this care giving field. Our culture has its own great care givers but there is a substantial presence of newcomers in this field.

            "body": "From left: Elijah Goodwin, 10, Angel Herrera-Sanchez, 9, Jose Verastagui, 10, Manuel Mendez, 9, and Devilyn Bolyard, 9, are headed to the VEX IQ worldwide robotics competition, which starts Sunday in Louisville. (Lisa Hopper) Just a few months ago, not many knew about these five fourth-graders from a low-income community in Indianapolis. But now, the Panther Bots, a thriving robotics team at Pleasant Run Elementary School, have become the face of a success story about a group of kids who were taunted with racial slurs but were too determined to let that affect their confidence. Earlier this month, they found themselves being honored on the Senate floor of the Indiana Statehouse. The group travels to Louisville on Sunday to compete in a worldwide robotics contest. \"I cried. I literally cried. I'm so emotional right now because I know it's hard for them,\" said Darshie Owens, whose son, 10-year-old Elijah Goodwin, is a member of the Panther Bots. \"I mean, like, going through the robotics competition. There's not a lot of African American students and not a lot of Hispanic students in robotics competitions.\" Getting to that point had not been easy. In early February, after the students won a local robotics challenge - a steppingstone to qualify for a state robotics championship - a couple of competitors from other schools were heard screaming, \"You need to go back to Mexico!\" [A teacher asked kids 'how comfortable' they are around black men, Muslims. She was fired.] Diocelina Herrera, a parent of one of the Panther Bots, said she heard the taunts after the competition as she and her family were walking to the parking lot and were about to leave. She said she also heard rumblings from fellow parents who referred to the winning students as Mexicans. \"We didn't say anything. We went to our car and left,\" Herrera said. \"We didn't want to get in an argument with these kinds of people.\" Herrera's son, Angel Herrera-Sanchez, was saddened by the incident, said Panther Bots coach Lisa Hopper. The 9-year-old wondered if he had done something to make people angry at him. \"'You were fine. You shouldn't worry about their actions. The way you guys competed and the way you held yourself at the competition was perfect, and we're so proud of you,'\" Hopper recalled telling the boy and his teammates. \"I just had to assure the kids that they had done everything correctly, and it wasn't due to anything they had done.\" The robotics team at Pleasant Run, where about 85 percent of students qualify for free or reduced lunch, was started last year, thanks to a grant from the office of the city's former mayor, Greg Ballard. The members were chosen after a series of tryouts in which fourth-graders who were recommended by their teachers were asked to build a Lego kit without instructions. [These California teachers mocked students for skipping school on immigrant boycott day] \"We just kind of watched to see who stepped up to the plate and took leadership roles, who's good at organizing and communicating and who works well with others,\" Hopper said. Five students - three Latinos and two African Americans - were selected. Elijah and Angel, along with 9-year-old Devilyn Bolyard, 10-year-old Jose Verastegui and 9-year-old Manuel Mendez, followed a robotics curriculum in which they were taught engineering and the basics of how to build a robot. The students built four prototypes before coming up with the final product they presented at competitions, Hopper said. They also did extensive research on self-driving cars and applied what they had learned to the programming of their robot. In late February, the team won best robot design during the statewide VEX IQ robotics competition and qualified for the VEX IQ world robotics tournament, a three-day event that starts Sunday at the Kentucky Exposition Center in Louisville. \"These five kids are some of the brightest and best kids I've had in my whole teaching career,\" Hopper said. \"They're a dream team, and it's been wonderful working with them.\" Before joining the robotics team, none of the children had expressed an interest in engineering. But they've now discovered passions they didn't have before. Angel, for example, had little interest in school and had poor grades last year. Now, he's at the top of his class and is already contemplating a career in engineering, said Herrera, his mother. Manuel had a similar transformation. Hopper said the boy's mother told her that he used to hate waking up every morning to go school. Now, he \"would just jump out of bed,\" Hopper said. [A 'dreamer' posted a selfie with her tax return. Then came the trolls.] Elijah, however, has always been interested in academics. He loves science and math and is a member of the student council, said Owens, his mother. He has thought about becoming an FBI agent, a politician or a basketball player. After news of the racial slur incident came out last month, scores of strangers have shown their support for the Panther Bots. More than 200 people raised about $12,000 to help send the team to the world competition. The teammates have received notes, cards, buttons and CDs from artists from around the country. They also received a banner wishing all the teams headed to the world championships good luck. On it was a special message to the kids: \"We support Panther Bots.\" Hopper said that two women, one from California and another from New York, have volunteered to travel to Louisville and surprise the kids with cupcakes and ice cream. \"The Panther Bots has friends and fans from almost every state,\" she said. Despite all the recognition, the students have remained humble. \"If you meet them, they're really laid-back and good kids,\" said Owens, a mother of six boys and one girl. \"They don't expect to win.\" Herrera, a mother of three, said the outpouring of support for her son and his teammates surprised her. \"There's too many good people,\" she said, \"and they cared.\" READ MORE: They met with immigration officers to apply for legal residency - only to be arrested by ICE Thousands of ICE detainees claim they were forced into labor, a violation of anti-slavery laws U.S. border officers told a Mexican teen to drink liquid meth.

            "body": "In case you missed it, here's a good profile of independent puzzle writer Andy Kravis. He's a fellow co-founder of the Indie 500 Crossword Tournament, and he's a genuinely good guy. And here's a separate profile of Andrew Ries, who has been in the indie puzzle game for many years (and is a prolific author of variety Rows Garden puzzles - I have zero idea how one goes about making those, but they're very impressive). Solution to April 23 crossword, \"Flipping the Script\" The theme is two-word movie titles, but with the two words flipped around: 23A: [Film about a sleeve covering depicting the second U.S. president?] is ADAMS PATCH, from \"Patch Adams.\" 25A: [Film about Clara, the famous nurse and stool pigeon?] is FINK BARTON, from \"Barton Fink.\" 37A: [Film about an occultist working at Chuck E. Cheese's?] is PIZZA MYSTIC, from \"Mystic Pizza.\" As several of my puzzle colleagues love to point out, the E of Chuck E. Cheese's is \"Entertainment,\" so the full name of the pizza mascot is Charles Entertainment Cheese. This may be the best thing about the pizza place. Please don't sue me, Chuck E. Cheese's. 52A: [Film about a Congress critter?] is HOUSE ANIMAL, from \"Animal House.\" I've seen political bloggers use the term \"Congresscritter\" (one word) as a slangy term for a representative in Congress, but is this in general usage? I'm not sure. 70A: [Film about an artificial lake filled with canines?] is DOGS RESERVOIR, from \"Reservoir Dogs.\" 89A: [Film about a place where one can work among the stars?] is SPACE OFFICE, from \"Office Space.\" 102A: [Film about the pizzazz of chef Ramsay?] is GORDON FLASH, from \"Flash Gordon.\" 119A: [Film about an equestrian cetacean?] is RIDER WHALE, from \"Whale Rider.\" I'm guessing that either this one or \"Mystic Pizza\" would be the least well-known among solvers, but who knows? 122A: [Film about mooning people through a sheet of glass?] is WINDOW REAR, from \"Rear Window.\" I've seen six of these movies, the other three being \"Mystic Pizza,\" \"Flash Gordon,\" and \"Whale Rider.\" I'm a tad ashamed that my only experience of \"Flash Gordon\" is half-heartedly singing the beginning of the theme song (\"FLASH! Ahhhhh.....\"). Some answers I left on the cutting-room floor include END HOWARDS, BOYS WONDER, RECALL TOTAL, LITTLE STUART, BUSINESS MONKEY, PSYCHO AMERICAN, and DUNDEE CROCODILE. I nearly went with RUNNER BLADE, but that answer appeared in a CrosSynergy puzzle by Dave Tuller back in July 2000. RAIDER TOMB was another one I hated to leave out, but technically, that wasn't the full title; the 2001 film was called \"Lara Croft: Tomb Raider.\" If this were the year 2018, it would work. Other notable answers and clues: 28A: [He gave \"Fantastic Four\" one star] is Roger EBERT. Obviously he didn't think it lived up to its name. 30A: [Anchorage areas] is HARBORS. I think this answer works in two ways. Anchorage, Alaska, is a port city, so there are harbors there; but \"anchorage\" also refers to a place where you can drop anchor (the latter is what I had intended). 81A: [Frequent co-star of Aykroyd] is John BELUSHI. I liked that I could fit him in the grid with ANIMAL HOUSE in there, too. 85A: [Looks at the Sun, say] is READS. The Baltimore Sun, that is. 1D: [Sound effect heard in Queen's \"Under Pressure\"] is a SNAP. My goodness, I only just learned that Queen did the theme song to \"Flash Gordon.\" Why didn't anybody tell me this? One of those \"I totally didn't plan it but I just had to do it\" moments: 8D and 9D are MACBETH and OPHELIA, respectively, both clued as [Tragic Shakespearean character]. 24D: [Arcade game consumer] is PAC-MAN. Think of \"consuming\" as eating. 48D / 60A: [With 60 Across, \"Yippee!\"] is HOT/DIGGITY. Normally when I have a long-ish word that can't stand on its own and probably needs a fill-in-the-blank clue (like DIGGITY), I'll usually do what I can to fit the rest of the phrase in the grid as well. In this case, I actually had HOT first. DIGGITY was just a happy coincidence. 59D: [Basketball star Bird] is SUE Bird. Not related to Larry, though. 96D: [Fantasy fiction?] is EROTICA. The adolescent in me says this is my favorite clue today. So, the last several weeks of Post Magazine puzzles were intended to be on the easier to medium side of difficulty. But the next two weeks? Those are going to be harder. You've been warned!",

            "body": "TOKYO - North Korea has detained another U.S. citizen, a Korean American professor, bringing to three the number of Americans being held in Pyongyang.  The Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, which represents U.S. interests there because the United States does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, confirmed to The Washington Post that a U.S. national had been detained. In Washington, the State Department said it was aware of the report. Media in South Korea identified the man as Kim Sang-duk, a former professor at the Yanbian University of Science and Technology (YUST) in the northeastern Chinese city of Yanji, near the border with North Korea. Kim was arrested at Pyongyang's international airport Friday as he was waiting to board a flight, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported.  Kim had been teaching a class in international finance and management at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, a sister institution, for a month and was leaving the country with his wife when he was arrested, the specialist website NK News quoted the chancellor of PUST, Park Chan-mo, as saying. [What it's like to be an American held in North Korea] North Korea has taken a slew of Americans hostage in recent years and used them as bargaining chips in negotiations with the United States. It is holding two other Americans.  Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia student who went on a tour in North Korea while on his way to a study-abroad program in Hong Kong, was detained for allegedly trying to steal a propaganda sign from a Pyongyang hotel on New Year's Day last year. He was convicted of subversion in March after a court found that he had committed a crime \"pursuant to the U.S. government's hostile policy\" toward North Korea and was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. [North Korea sentences college student to 15 years of hard labor] He has not been seen since March 2016, when he was convicted, and when Swedish diplomats were last allowed to meet with him.  Another American, former Virginia man Kim Dong-chul, was charged with spying last April and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Kim, who is in his early 60s, was born in South Korea but became a U.S. citizen in 1987, although he is thought to have been living in northeastern China in recent years. Previous American detainees have been released after a few months following visits from high-profile Americans, including former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. But so far, the North Korean regime has not used Warmbier and Kim as leverage.

            "body": "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump meet for their first presidential debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y., on Sept. 26. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) I argued last week that anecdotal stories about disillusioned Trump supporters were overdone. The fact is that, on a broad scale, Trump supporters say they aren't disappointed. In fact, a poll showed they were more pleased than disappointed, by about 5 to 1: ...The Pew Research Center released a poll showing very little buyer's remorse among Trump voters. The poll showed just 7 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say Trump has performed worse than they expected him to. Fully 38 percent - five times as many - say he has performed better. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll confirms this - in spades. And, in fact, it shows more buyer's remorse for Trump's opponent in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton. And were the 2016 election held again today, it shows Trump would avenge his popular-vote loss. While just 4 percent of Trump's supporters say they would back someone else if there was a redo of the election, fully 15 percent of Clinton supporters say they would ditch her. Trump leads in a re-do of the 2016 election 43 percent to 40 percent after losing the popular vote 46-44. That 15 percent is split between those who say they would vote for Trump (2 percent), Gary Johnson (4 percent), Jill Stein (2 percent), and either other candidates or not vote (7 percent). It's not hugely surprising that the losing candidate in an election would see this kind of drop-off. People don't like voting for losers, and if you look closely at polls after an election, some voters won't even admit to having cast their ballots for the losing candidate. The winning margin for the victor is generally exaggerated. But against the backdrop of stories about how Trump hasn't delivered what his supporters thought he would, it's notable how much his backers are sticking by their candidate, relative to his opponent. There is basically no real defection to the one candidate who could have delivered a different result. Of course, you can still be disappointed in Trump and not say you wish you had voted differently. But this poll also reinforces the idea that Trump supporters aren't even disappointed. Not in the least, in fact. Just 2 percent of those who voted for Trump say he has been a worse president than they expected. Only 1 percent say he has been \"much worse,\" and 1 percent say he has been \"somewhat worse.\" In contrast, 62 percent say he has been better than expected, with one-third (33 percent) saying he has been \"much better.\" That's not disillusioned Trump supporters; that's quite the opposite. And we have yet to see a poll that suggests there are a bunch of disgruntled Trump voters out there, stewing over their decision to install a reality show star as president. As President Trump nears his 100th day in office, a new Washington Post-ABC News poll found that a historically low 42 percent of Americans approve of his job performance thus far. His efforts to keep jobs in the U.S. is one area of bipartisan support among heavy criticism of his judgment, honesty and accomplishments. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)",

He has taken no action on 36 promises \u2014 60 percent of them.\" When he delivers, it will start the remorse. If he delivers, that is.

            "body": "Kale has had a long run in the health-food limelight. Now its cousins - including bok choy, broccoli, Brussels sprouts and, especially, cauliflower - are being touted as the coolest vegetables on the block. But to scientists and nutritionists, this family of vegetables, called crucifers, has always been hot. \"Cruciferous vegetables are among the most nutritious because they are rich in several vitamins and minerals, plus they contain unique disease-fighting compounds,\" says Maxine Siegel, who heads Consumer Reports' food-testing department. Benefits for your body Cruciferous vegetables are the most common dietary sources of glucosinolates. These are natural chemicals that give the veggies their pungent flavor and break down into cancer-protecting compounds. A study in the Annals of Oncology found that just one serving per week over a two-year period lowered the risk of breast, colon and oral cancer by 17 percent; esophageal cancer by 28 percent; and kidney cancer by 32 percent. Each type of vegetable has different anti-cancer compounds, so it's best to eat a variety. This vegetable family stands out for its rich bounty of vision-protecting carotenoids as well as fiber, folate, potassium and vitamins C, E and K. Some of these nutrients may contribute to that cancer-fighting ability, but they may also be part of the reason crucifers help control inflammation and protect against heart disease. In an analysis of 134,796 people, researchers in China found that those who ate about six ounces of crucifers per day reduced their risk of heart disease by about 20 percent compared with those who ate an ounce or less. Cooking and serving tips Steam or stir-fry. These methods preserve the most glucosinolates. Aim for an al dente texture. Overcooking not only turns these vegetables an unappetizing color but also makes them mushy, gives them a stronger flavor than you might like, and diminishes the nutrient content. Try Brussels sprout chips. Remove the leaves from the base. Toss with olive oil and bake at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes or until crispy, turning every five minutes. Make a slaw. Season thinly sliced raw cabbage with rice-wine vinegar and olive oil. Use as a topping for fish tacos. Test-tube studies suggest that cabbage's sulfur compounds make the selenium in fish a more potent cancer fighter. Hang on to broccoli leaves and stems. Peel stalks and slice into coins to use in pasta dishes or as a dipper for hummus. Saut\u00e9 greens with garlic in olive oil. Use watercress for more than a garnish. Mix it with milder greens such as baby spinach, and pair with sweet and creamy ingredients including lemon juice, avocado and apple slices to balance out the strong flavor. Copyright 2017.

            "body": "In January 2003, Suzanne Gonzales wrote to an online messaging group: \"I cry for no reason, and I can't help but feel that I'm bothering others with my whining. I'm sorry to everyone. It would just be best if I would go away.\" She had been suffering from depression and, in the following months, she often went to this website to talk about suicide. It was a place where suicide was normal, or even encouraged. Anonymous users told her it was okay to kill herself, lending her detailed advice on how to do it. In March, Gonzales checked in to a hotel room and drank a cup of poison, according to news accounts. She was 19 years old when she died. The death of Gonzales is a frightening tale about dark corners of the Internet and the role it can play in the lure of suicide. While suicide has long been a public health issue in the United States, leading to more than 40,000 deaths each year, mental health experts are just coming to grips with how the Internet influences suicide risk and prevention. [Can exercise cure depression and anxiety?] Suicide-related information is readily accessible online. Using the Internet to read about suicide can provide a beacon of hope, as much of the available content promotes prevention or resources for those in distress. Yet a number of studies have raised concerns about websites that may encourage suicide and self-harm. One site, for instance, advertises itself as \"a place where people who are interested in suicide methods come together and discuss about suicide methods.\" In a study published in 2008, researchers put phrases related to suicide (e.g., \"How to kill yourself\") into search engines and examined the first 10 sites from each search. The authors found that about 1 in 5 of these top hits were sites encouraging suicide or describing suicide methods. A more recent study compared the top suicide-related search results from 2007 to 2014, and found the proportion of sites providing factual information about suicide methods had tripled. Research suggests these websites draw people, particularly youths, who are in distress. In a survey of 1,500 young people living in the United States, browsers who visited pro-suicide sites were 11 times as likely to report thinking about self-harm and seven times as likely to report having suicidal thoughts as were young people who hadn't visited the sites. A 2015 study found that 20 percent of young adults with a history of suicidal self-harm had visited sites containing information on how to kill or hurt oneself, compared with just 3 percent of a young adults more broadly. What's less clear is the motivation behind these websites: Why would someone encourage others to kill themselves, often providing detailed instructions on how to do so? The relative anonymity of the Internet makes this question challenging to study. Some academics have speculated that pro-suicide sites may serve as forums for commiseration, community or even rebellion, but there aren't much data to make firm conclusions. After Suzanne Gonzales died, her parents, Mike and Mary Gonzales, decided to take a stand against people who promote suicide online. Working with them, Walter Herger, then a Republican congressman from California, introduced a bill that would criminalize using the Internet to promote suicide. The bill was named the Suzanne Gonzales Suicide Prevention Act of 2007, or \"Suzy's Law.\" Plenty of state laws make it illegal to knowingly assist in suicide, particularly as it applies to physician-patient situations. But the legal implications of using the Internet to encourage suicide are murky. For starters, websites and users may be based in different states or overseas. Also, it could be hard to prove that online posts directly led to another person's self-harm. Our aversion to cracking down on free speech online also comes into play. The United States ranks among the top countries for Internet freedom, and American courts have tended to side with protecting freedom of expression online. But regulating content and activity that promote suicide online isn't impossible. In 2011, William Melchert-Dinkel, was convicted in Minnesota of assisting suicide via the Internet. A nurse, he had encouraged people he met online to kill themselves and offered detailed methods; two of them, a Canadian man and a British woman, eventually died by suicide. The case has stirred multiple legal battles, at one point finding its way to the Minnesota Supreme Court, but Melchert-Dinkel eventually served jail time for assisting suicide. In 2006, Australia became one of the first countries to criminalize pro-suicide sites. After dozens of people in Japan killed themselves in 2008 using a gas method described online, national police asked Internet providers to take down online content spreading the information. South Korea and Russia have taken similar steps. Suicide remains difficult to predict, and we're just beginning to understand the role of the Internet in mental-health outcomes. Still, the rise of pro-suicide activity online poses tough questions about the boundaries of free speech and what constitutes acceptable online use. In particular, do we want the Internet to be a place where people can learn about - and even be drawn into - killing themselves? A decade has passed since Suzy's Law was first introduced, but it has yet to gain traction in Washington. The Gonzales family has tried to keep the bill alive by getting it reintroduced every few years, including in 2009 and 2011. Mike Gonzales recently told me that he felt the country had made important strides in talking about mental health, but he hopes that more will be done to stop pro-suicide activity online. \"I'm all for free speech,\" he told an interviewer shortly after his daughter's death, \"but once you start telling young impressionable kids how to kill themselves, that's crossing the line. Someone's got to be held accountable.\" He said he still believes that. If you are in crisis or you know of someone who is, you may want to call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 or visit suicidepreventionlifeline.org.

                "As hard as suicide is on the survivors, the depression that leads many people to commit suicide is even harder for the sufferer to bear.  Instead of just talking about preventing suicide, how about finding a way to alleviate the suffering of those who are drawn to the idea of ending it all?  How about funding research to find cures for mental illnesses?  How about getting rid of the stigma of seeking help for these conditions?   How about funding community based mental health care clinics?  How about teaching mental wellness along with other heath issues in high school?

                "This is a reckless and disingenuous article. It notes the Melchert-Dinkel case without noting that the very reason why the original conviction was overturned was that the Minnesota Supreme Court found that merely advising or encouraging suicide in general terms was covered by the First Amendment. Suzy's Law would also be an unconstitutional affront to our civil liberties. Evidently you don't care so long as people can be punished by illegitimate laws before they're overturned. That's the only way I can interpret the fact that you're aware that Melchert-Dinkel's first conviction was overturned on free speech grounds but you note, with approval, that he still spent time in jail. That kind of authoritarian mindset is far more frightening than the possibility that some people will be able to do what they want with their own lives and deaths.", 
                "Talk about the \"Nanny\" State. Each person now owns ONLY his or her selfhood.  Don't want your kid reading about suicide, fine, block the sites. Adults deserve to be able to learn how to terminate their existence when it becomes, for ANY reason, intolerable. Life is NOT always a wonderful thing.

EXPRESS FORECAST Today: Partly to mostly cloudy and cool, isolated shower? Highs: Near 60. Tonight: Cloudy with periods of showers. Lows: Mid-40s to near 50. Tomorrow: Numerous showers. Highs: 50s. View the current weather conditions at The Washington Post headquarters. FORECAST IN DETAIL A weak area of high pressure should give us a mostly dry but partly to mostly cloudy day to close out the weekend. The rain returns later tonight and tomorrow, though, as a slow-moving area of low pressure keeps us thoroughly socked in through Tuesday. Not until Wednesday do drier and warmer conditions make a comeback. Today (Sunday): Other than perhaps a couple isolated showers or sprinkles, weak high pressure should be just enough to keep the rain mostly confined south of the D.C. area (mainly south of Fredericksburg) for most of the day. Partly to mostly cloudy skies allow some breaks of sun, especially in our northern suburbs. Otherwise, winds are light from the east-northeast, with highs headed for near 60. Confidence: Medium-High Tonight: Showers edge closer from the south and west during the evening, with rain likely everywhere by late evening and overnight. It's a cloudy and rather raw night overall, with an increasing wind from the northeast and lows falling to the mid-40s to near 50 with some areas of fog likely. Confidence: Medium-High Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the latest updates. For related traffic news, check out Dr. Gridlock. Keep reading for the forecast through midweek... Tomorrow (Monday): Low pressure creeping up the Southeast coast should bring plenty of April showers. The rain looks mainly of the light-to-moderate variety but could still start to eat into that drought of ours. Continued cloudy skies and a 10-15 mph wind from the northeast keep highs stuck in the 50s. Confidence: Medium Marching in the rain yesterday past the National Gallery of Art. (Joe Flood via Flickr) Tomorrow night: It's considerably darker, and that's about the only change. Batches of showers continue to work their way through the region as clouds and fog dominate. Overnight lows drop back to the upper 40s to low 50s. Confidence: Medium A LOOK AHEAD By Tuesday, that low-pressure area doesn't look to have made much progress, probably sitting and spinning along the North Carolina coast. That leaves us stuck in a similar pattern, with mostly cloudy skies and scattered showers likely and cool highs in the mid-50s to near 60. Shower chances continue Tuesday evening but we should start to dry out overnight, with temperatures fairly steady in the low to mid-50s.  Confidence: Low-Medium We look to finally break out of the funk on Wednesday as the system moves off to the northeast. Early clouds and a possible lingering shower should give way to brightening skies and highs in the 70s, with plenty more warmth on the way for the remainder of the week. Confidence: Medium",

            "body": "Since his first trip to Mar-a-Lago in early February, the longest stretch Donald Trump has gone without visiting one of the properties that is part of his private business empire has been six days. From March 27 to April 1, he didn't spend time at Mar-a-Lago or at the Trump International Golf Club in Florida or at Trump National in Virginia or at his hotel down the street from the White House. Of the 94 days he has been president, he has spent all or part of his time at Trump-branded properties on 33 of them, or an average of once every 2.8 days. He has visited one of his private properties on at least one day during each of the past 12 weekends. On Saturday, he had dinner at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, his second such visit since being inaugurated and his fourth this year. A new poll from The Washington Post and our partners at ABC News finds, though, that most Americans don't see this as a conflict of interest. Forty-three percent of Americans see these trips as a conflict, but a majority, 54 percent, don't. (The question posed to respondents: \"Do you think that Trump spending time at properties he owns represents a conflict of interest because it promotes those properties, or do you think this is not a conflict because he has the right to go where he wants?\") There's a broad split by party and by 2016 vote choice, as you might expect. Half of those who voted third party say it's a conflict, as do 72 percent of those who voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton. But among Republicans and Trump voters, fewer than 1 in 10 see it as a conflict. Importantly, among independents - a group that has been more critical of Trump than of other recent new presidents - fewer than half express concern. There hasn't been any indication that Trump is particularly concerned about questions over the amount of time he spends at his private business properties. This poll suggests that, politically at least, that indifference is warranted.",

The D.C. White House is a very public fish bowl where he is scheduled by the minute and constantly observed.   He is profoundly uncomfortable there because it is really not his turf, nor will it ever be.  He flees to Mar-A-Lago to be in total control of his (un)natural habitat: he calls the shots on everything there.   \n\nI find it very telling that of all the world leaders who have come for state visits thus far, he met with Abe of Japan and Xi of China at his private club where he's staged crude male dominance displays: \"Look what I own!  Look what I can bomb!  Look at my chocolate cake!\"  This is diplomacy as defined by Trump.  To their credit, neither Abe nor Xi appear to have been impressed.  \n\nWhenever Trump goes down to Palm Beach, I expect that something outrageous will happen shortly thereafter: crazy tweets, quid pro quo business deals, bungled international crises.

In her opening monologue at the event, the \"Saturday Night Live\" comedian introduced the six women who would be honored that afternoon: Jessica Chastain, Gayle King, Blake Lively, Audra McDonald, Tina Knowles, Shari Redstone and Clinton. \"And they all have one thing in common,\" Bayer quipped. \"None of their moms are president.\" The audience groaned a little at that point. [On 'Saturday Night Live,' Jimmy Fallon stays soft on Trump] Upon accepting her honor, for her work with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, Clinton mostly spoke about the group's efforts to combat childhood obesity. For five minutes, it seemed as though Clinton might let Bayer's remarks go unnoticed, though she did speak of valuable lessons that her grandmother and parents had taught her about gratitude and persistence. But Clinton closed with a line that touched on her mother's presidential run - and seemed to give the \"SNL\" star the benefit of the doubt. \"Vanessa, we may be able to say in this room today that no one's mother is currently president,\" Clinton said, addressing Bayer. \"But someday, someone's will be.\" Chelsea Clinton, actress Jessica Chastain and Fox News whistleblower Gretchen Carlson attended the Power of Women luncheon in New York held by Variety magazine on April 21. (Reuters) The 37-year-old daughter of Bill and Hillary Clinton has been in the public eye since her father was elected president 25 years ago. She also emerged on the campaign trail in recent years to support her mother's presidential candidacy. However, over the decades, Chelsea Clinton has mostly shied away from the most controversial public debates - until recently, in the months after President Trump's surprise win against her mother. \"In recent days, we've noticed a different Chelsea Clinton - one more than willing to speak out, often a bit bluntly,\" The Washington Post's Aaron Blake reported in February. \"And she's speaking out specifically against President Trump, using his preferred medium: Twitter.\" [Chelsea Clinton gives the same non-answer to the one question everyone asks] The younger Clinton has repeatedly stated that she has no plans to run for office, but it hasn't stopped others from encouraging her to do so - not has it stopped people from speculating that her denials actually leave the door open to some future campaign. This included King, who on Friday resurrected talk of Chelsea running for office. \"I'll resist the urge to say Chelsea 2024,\" the TV personality said from the podium, according to the Associated Press. \"I won't say it.\" Read more: Chelsea Clinton finally finds her political voice - and it's edgy Chelsea Clinton takes daughter Charlotte to her first protest A complete guide to every reference in Melissa McCarthy's epic Sean Spicer sketch on SNL",

            "body": "Within two years of having a heart attack, nearly 1 in 5 people stop taking lifesaving cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins, according to a new study. And nearly 2 in 5 end up taking the drugs in lower doses or less often than they should, researchers report in JAMA Cardiology. \"From a societal perspective, we need to make sure the highest-risk individuals are being treated with guideline-directed therapy,\" said senior author Robert Rosenson, a professor of cardiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. Rosenson and colleagues write that guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommend high-intensity statins for people age 75 and younger who have coronary heart disease. The pills help prevent cardiovascular events. Statins include medications such as Lipitor, sold generically as atorvastatin, and Crestor, also known as rosuvastatin. They work by inhibiting the production of cholesterol in the liver. Rosenson said his team had previously found low use of high-intensity statins in heart-attack survivors. The new study aimed to find out what traits were associated with discontinuing or reducing these drugs. The researchers analyzed data collected from 57,898 people age 66 and older who had been hospitalized for a heart attack between 2007 and 2012. They had all filled a prescription for a high-intensity statin within 30 days of leaving the hospital. After six months, about 59 percent of people age 66 to 75 continued to regularly take their high-intensity statin. About 9 percent switched to a lower dose. About another 17 percent took the medications irregularly, and about 12 percent stopped taking the drugs altogether. After two years, only about 42 percent were regularly taking their statins. About 13 percent had switched to a lower dose. About 19 percent were taking the drugs infrequently and another 19 percent had stopped the drugs altogether. The researchers saw similar results for people 75 and older, for whom the ACC/AHA guidelines generally recommend a slightly lower dose of statins. African Americans and Hispanics, and those taking statins for the first time, were less likely than others to take their medication regularly. People were more likely to regularly take their statins if they saw their cardiologists often, took part in cardiac rehabilitation programs or were enrolled in Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income people that is administered by states and the federal government. The researchers conclude that lower costs, more cardiologist visits and cardiac rehabilitation may boost the number of people staying on high-intensity statins and ultimately reduce the risk of repeat heart attacks. Rosenson noted that statins are available in less expensive generic forms as well as under brand labels. \"You can't say that cost accounts for all of this,\" he said. People should know that statins have benefits beyond lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL), also known as \"bad\" cholesterol, he said. They also have anti-inflammatory benefits. \"I think what the public needs to know is: Discontinuing or down-titrating your statins is associated with a greater risk of having a second heart attack and being in the hospital with a cardiovascular event that may result in a procedure that results in higher health-care cost for them and the entire public,\" he said.",

They use the term \"relative risk\" to overstate their benefit. On top of that,  there is also much evidence that the side effects and risks are grossly under reported.", 
                "You are wrong.  Although the benefits to those who do not have previous heart disease can be modest, for those who have had a first heart attack, the reduction in second heart attacks with combined medical therapy (statins, aspirin, and treatment for hypertension) can be as high as 50%, (depending upon the study).  That is very large.  So the question of why the muscle pain, and what can be done about it, is a very important issue.  True proposes to devastate NIH funding in a way that will gut research for a decade or more.  Fund NIH.  It promotes a better life for all of us.", 
                "Are we talking about a relative risk reduction of 50 %? If so, what is the real reduction in absolute terms?   Do all studies show this, or do only certain studies that the sponsors chose to make public?  So you mentioned combined treatment - if that is the case, how do you know which part of that combination is causing any gains?  And you talk about muscle pain - that is only one of the many side effects that these drugs cause.  They also cause liver damage - which can be fatal, memory loss, thyroid problems - just to name a few.  A study done showed that about 80 % of doctors did not take classic statin side effects seriously and even less reported the symptoms to the FDA.  I am not against reducing NIH funding in any way.", 
                "No, I am not wrong.", 
                "An intense statin dose DOES  reduce second heart attacks A LOT.  That is the DATA.  The problem is that at those doses, weakness and muscle pain is frequent, especially in older people.  These effects can be pretty severe, at the most extreme end, some peoples muscles actually can start to dissolve in a life threatening manner.  but what is common, is the \"ouch, ouch\" of muscle pain with every step going down the stairs.  There has been a fair amount of work on this, but there needs to be more research.  NIH funding is critical to address exactly this type of issue:  a wonder drug that many do not take because it hurts their muscles.  Pharma is not going to do this.  YOUR TAX DOLLARS is needed to address this and many other similar issues that effect the health of millions.", 
                "I disagree about the large risk reduction.  This People's Pharmacy article shows quite clearly how flawed the so called benefits are.  https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/2017/03/27/does-the-new-cholesterol-drug-repatha-save-lives/", 
                "For many indiividuals the muscle pain caused by statins can be severe.  I've had them.  It was like being permanently very stiff from intense exercise.", 
                "Completely agree. You will never hear an honest discussion from any cardiologist about the side effects of any drug they want you to take. When I questioned my cardiologist, his reply was a smirked, \"Heart is more important,\" and then he walked out of the room. And he's one of Washingtonian's \"Best Doctors\" in 2016", 
                "People quit the statins because of the severe and long-lasting if not permanent side effects. Read the package insert. It doesn't lie and is all true. The doctors make money prescribing them, and the drug companies get rich. Not sure if they are the life-saving drugs that they are marketed as.",

She was 56. Emergency responders found her unresponsive at a trailer park after the sheriff's department received a 911 call, the department said. An autopsy is pending to determine the cause of death. Ms. Moran, who was born in Burbank, Calif., began acting in TV and movies before she was 10. She had several years of experience when she was cast in 1974 in \"Happy Days\" as Joanie Cunningham, the kid sister to high school student Richie Cunningham, played by Ron Howard, who went on to become a successful filmmaker. Her more recent credits included \"The Love Boat\" and \"Murder, She Wrote,\" but she never approached the early success of \"Happy Days,\" and in recent years she was more often in the news for her numerous personal and financial struggles, including with drugs and alcohol. She was reportedly homeless at times. \"Such sad sad news. RIP Erin,\" Howard tweeted Saturday. \"I'll always choose to remember you on our show making scenes better, getting laughs and lighting up TV screens.\" Erin Moran, left, and Marion Ross, who played her mother on \"Happy Days,\" in 2009. (Matt Sayles/AP) \"Happy Days\" cast members, including Howard, expressed condolences on social media platforms. \"What happened with all of us was like we were this family,\" Ms. Moran told the Xfinity.com blog in 2009. \"It was so surreal with all the cast members. ... They were my family, get it?\" Debuting at a time of nostalgia for the seemingly innocent 1950s, \"Happy Days\" was set in Milwaukee and became a long-running hit. Howard and Henry Winkler were the show's biggest stars, but the smiling, freckle-faced Ms. Moran also became popular. In 1982, she was paired off with fellow \"Happy Days\" performer Scott Baio in the short-lived \"Joanie Loves Chachi.\" Ms. Moran returned to \"Happy Days\" in 1984, the show's final season. \"I would love to do a feature (film), I'd love to do a play,\" she told CNN in 1981 when asked what she'd like to do after \"Happy Days.\" In 2011, Ms. Moran and several other former \"Happy Days\" actors sued CBS, saying they were owed money for merchandising related to the show. The lawsuit was settled the following year. Ms. Moran told Xfinity that she had been working on a memoir, called \"Happy Days, Depressing Nights.\" 1 of 42 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Notable deaths so far this year View Photos Remembering those who have died in 2017.

I think the viciousness of passing fame is not easy to process as one moment you are in demand and the next you are a nonperson. Then Erin had these guys who could only dream of her success as significant others who tried to mute her celebrity. There is no manual that tells you how to adjust to being out of the public eye or losing a great job or losing a relationship. Some can adjust and some struggle with it. RIP Erin.",

In Portugal, a policy of treatment for addiction, not imprisonment, has brought use rates down to about 20% of what they once were. \n\nIn the US, we have integrated the drug trade into military, financial, real estate sectors, making all of these corrupt, hollow economic sectors. \n\nLook at the numbers. \n\nThe transition out of this mess will not be easy.",

                "You're right about the politics and history, but I don't think that's what killed her.\n\nOnce she was no longer working regularly as an actress, back in the early 90s, she should have gotten a real job in the real world.  Instead she existed on the margins of Hollywood, never earning as much  money as she could have if she had a real 9-5 job.\n \nShe was living in Palmdale, a hot, dusty place for people who can't even afford the Valley. Then in 2008 she lost her house to foreclosure. \nOnce she moved to a trailer park in southern Indiana, just outside of Louiville, KY, she was done. That environment was only going to facilitate her downfall."

The complex is in the 2500 block of Corning Avenue in Fort Washington, just south of the Capital Beltway. Brady called it a \"significant\" fire and said numerous residents needed help getting down from their balconies. One woman on a middle floor handed her baby down to others on the ground level before climbing down herself, Brady said. In all, five people were evaluated for injuries and two were hospitalized: the woman in her 80s, who jumped down and landed on a grassy patch, and her daughter, who was in her 60s, and who was brought down by ladder. The three others included a firefighter who fell ill fighting the blaze, but eventually returned to duty, officials said. No injuries were immediately reported. The fire appeared to be accidental, Brady said, and damage was estimated to be in the range of $150,000. He said about 50 firefighters and paramedics responded, and the blaze was extinguished within about 20 minutes. The fire left all 11 of the building's apartments uninhabitable, however.

            "body": "A torn poster bearing an image of Marine Le Pen, the far-right candidate in the French presidential election, outside a polling station in Paris. (Emilio Morenatti/AP) PARIS - After one of France's most divisive election campaigns, voters headed to the polls Sunday amid tight security. No candidate has been able to dominate the campaign and become the undisputed favorite in the race. But though few voters are enthusiastic about the candidates, many said Sunday that they were aware of what was at stake. Here are some reactions from the streets of France as the election got underway. Little enthusiasm among young urban French: L\u00e9on Blum Square in central Paris In front of a polling station at the L\u00e9on Blum Square in the 11th district of Paris, not far from the Bataclan nightclub and the Place de la Republique, four soldiers were patrolling with submachine guns Sunday morning. The mostly young voters emerging from the mayor's office, one of the designated polling places, voiced little enthusiasm about the candidates they had just picked. Sophie Girardeaus, 30, and her boyfriend said President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is partially to blame for the indecision among younger voters. The couple said Hollande failed to deliver on one of his central promises from the 2012 election, to support French youths, leading to a more general political apathy. [ What to watch for in the first round of the French presidential election ] \"But all of this comes after Brexit and the Trump victory, so I hope that particularly left-wing voters will still come out to vote against the far-right populists,\" Girardeaus said. Others were more skeptical. \"This was an extremely weird campaign, and I did not know whom to vote for until a few days ago. It's the first time something like this has happened to me,\" said a 31-year old who gave his name as simply Ranain. He ended up voting for Emmanuel Macron. A divided country: Saint-Denis and neighboring Villeneuve-la-Garenne to the north of Paris In the Parisian suburb of Saint-Denis, the divisive rhetoric of the campaign was echoed by many who voted Sunday afternoon. A neighborhood with a disproportionately high immigrant population, Saint Denis made international headlines when Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected ringleader of the November 2015 attacks, was killed in a police raid.

(Philippe Lopez/AFP via Getty Images) Not far from where Abaaoud was killed, voters worried about the impact of terrorism on the election. \"If Le Pen makes it, everything will become worse for us. Then the French will show their real faces - I don't think it is exaggerated to say that there would be violence,\" said Ginette Beljour, 40, who wanted to vote for Macron. Standing in front of a polling station in Villeneuve-la-Garenne, Le Pen supporter St\u00e9phane Debuigne, 29, said France needed a political leader who was capable of saying 'No' to the German chancellor or the European Union. \"People like Fran\u00e7ois Hollande always only say yes to them,\" he said. \"France needs a politician who cares about the people who work and who will fix our immigration problem.\" A turn to the far right: H\u00e9nin-Beaumont in northern France In H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, an industrial town deep in France's northern rust belt, many turned out for Le Pen. Along with neighboring communities, this quiet town is something of a stronghold of her party, the National Front: It has had a mayor from the party since 2014, and it is here that Le Pen cast her ballot Sunday morning. H\u00e9nin-Beaumont is also where her campaign is hosting its party for supporters to watch the election returns later Sunday. [ French citizens vote in an uncertain race that could determine Europe's future ] David and Linda Renard were walking home from the polling station in a local school with their two daughters. Their Chihuahua, Lili, followed them on a leash. \"I feel like I've lost a lot of purchasing power with the euro,\" said David, 41, who said he worked in financial services. \"My salary was much higher when we were on the franc.\" Linda Renard, 42, a nurse, said she was not bothered by the history of the National Front as she cast her ballot. Marine Le Pen \"doesn't have the ideas of her father,\" she said, referring to Jean-Marie Le Pen, a convicted Holocaust denier who once referred to the Nazi gas chambers as a \"detail of history,\" a remark that landed the National Front in the political wilderness for decades.

Mitchell/Getty Images) Marie-Pierre Thibault, 67, a retired midwife who has called H\u00e9nin-Beaumont home since 1978, said the National Front has little negative connotation in this town. \"We are very, very happy with our mayor,\" she said of Steeve Briois, who is also a member of the European Parliament. \"He's done innumerable things for our village - he renovated the church, for example, and he brought back the carnival, which had disappeared for many years.\" Marine Le Pen \"has changed immensely since the last election,\" Linda Rinard said. \"She's less blunt, more composed, and it's clear that she reflects very carefully on what she says.\" For others, terrorism - especially in the aftermath of Thursday's attack in Paris - was the issue at hand. Patricia Villain, 50, a nurse in H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, said the biggest threat to France was terrorism. \"I hope she remains what she is and does what she says. I hope she will actually, really change things - especially terrorism,\" Villain said, referring to Le Pen. James McAuley reported from H\u00e9nin-Beaumont.

            "body": "Which of the following correctly describes the reason for including a dress code with an invitation? - To sharpen your rapier wit on your would-be guests. - To inspire your friends to reach new heights of sartorial creativity, challenging them to think ''outside the box.'' (Inside the box there is now so much unclaimed real estate that those of us still in residence are not coming out, barring actual flooding.) - To sow confusion. If you chose any or all of the above, you may join the majority of your fellow citizens who celebrate their individuality by conforming as strictly as possible to the prejudices of their peers. It is more crowded in this box than Miss Manners had thought. The purpose of a dress code is to save your guests from having to guess what is expected, while comforting them that if they wear what is asked, they will not spend the evening dodging dirty looks from a partner - or having to regale friends with the hilarious story of how their ties got caught in the car door. Miss Manners would have thought this would be appreciated by the perpetually overbooked and uncomfortable Modern Lady and Gentleman. Such is not the case. Miss Manners does realize that some of the more fanciful dress codes are intended to be humorous and playful, but there are places where humor does not belong. Fire exit signs and confessions that you wrecked your parents' car come to mind. A proper dress code should be understandable to its intended audience. Once upon a time, it was understood that \"formal'' meant white tie, \"informal'' meant black tie, and the absence of a direction was what some now term \"business attire.'' Decades of improvisation have destroyed that understanding, relegating such terms to the waste bin of useless words, where they sit next to \"semiformal'' and \"inflammable,'' awaiting a final disposal that never comes. \"Black tie,'' \"jacket and tie,'' and, in the case of public accommodations, \"no flip-flops'' lack joie de vivre, but they make up for it in intelligibility. Notice that most dress codes specify what is expected of the gentleman, rather than the lady. One would think husbands would be used to this by now, but the reason for it is practical. Male clothing, particularly as it increases in formality, is more prescribed than female clothing. Who, other than the owner, can say which is a lady's second-best dress? If all this is too much for you when issuing invitations, there is no requirement to specify a dress code. The smart (though confused) guest will call and ask, and you may then discuss it at as great length as you feel up to. At least it will take less time than trying to parse the differences between \"cocktail attire,'' \"smart casual,'' \"tea party dress,'' \"country club wear'' and \"after-five attire.'' As for \"business casual,'' Miss Manners suspects that it is not a dress code but an accounting practice, accessorized with handcuffs and subpoenas. Dear Miss Manners: How long do you have to send out wedding thank-you cards? Starting from the time that each gift arrives, until you get to the end of the list of people to whom you should be thankful. And, Miss Manners decrees, not a minute longer.

Had a friend complain that she was told not to wear black to a certain wedding. I grew up believing black was for funerals, and never for weddings (unless black tie).

            "body": "Earlier this year, when Rupert Murdoch and senior executives at Fox News's parent company signed Bill O'Reilly to a new multiyear contract, they knew something the rest of the world didn't: The star host had been accused of sexual and verbal harassment by women at Fox five times over the preceding 15 years. They knew it because the company, 21st Century Fox, had paid money to settle two of the complaints. They also knew that the public was unlikely to find out because attorneys for O'Reilly and the company had signed his accusers to agreements binding them to confidentiality. In exchange for their silence and a promise not to sue, the women received payments totaling $3 million from 21st Century Fox. Those settlements came on top of some $10 million that O'Reilly himself had paid earlier to three other women who had complained about his behavior while working at Fox. They also came after a bruising sexual harassment scandal involving Fox News co-founder and chairman Roger Ailes last summer, one in which 21st Century Fox paid some $35 million to settle a lawsuit by former Fox presenter Gretchen Carlson and allegations against Ailes by several unidentified women. This was in addition to $40 million paid to Ailes as severance. ['The mission was to bring down Bill O'Reilly: The final days of a Fox News superstar] In effect, Rupert Murdoch and his sons James and Lachlan, who run 21st Century Fox, took a calculated risk. They re-signed O'Reilly - Fox News's most valuable asset - fully aware of his history but in the apparent hope that they could continue with business as usual, according to knowledgeable people at the company. Just to be safe, however, the company added an unusual feature to O'Reilly's new contract: A clause permitting 21st Century Fox to terminate him, with up to a year's salary as severance, if new allegations arose. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) In the end, the Murdochs' bet on their guaranteed moneymaker didn't pay off. A scathing investigation by the New York Times in early April about the allegations surrounding O'Reilly triggered an advertiser exodus from his top-rated program, \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" and brought out at least three more complaints against the opinionated host. It ultimately led the Murdoch family to invoke the termination clause on Wednesday, ending O'Reilly's 21-year career at Fox. He has maintained that the complaints against him are unfounded, and plans to return to the air Monday with his \"No Spin News\" podcast. The O'Reilly debacle raises questions about 21st Century Fox's stated commitment to ensuring a hostility-free environment. In one of their few public statements about the problem in the scandal-scarred Fox News Channel workplace, James, 44, and Lachlan, 45, said after Ailes's ouster last summer, \"We continue our commitment to maintaining a work environment based on trust and -respect.\" Yet after making that pledge, the company settled two more allegations against O'Reilly - one with former anchor Laurie Dhue, who left the network in 2008, and another with Juliet Huddy, a former network host. According to the Times, the company also offered last year to settle, for $1 million, a lawsuit brought by Andrea Tantaros, who appeared regularly on Fox News. Tantaros's suit is against the network and Ailes, but she also claimed in her complaint that O'Reilly made unwelcome advances. Fox has denied her claims; her suit is in \"confidential arbitration,\" according to Irena Briganti, Fox News's spokeswoman. A spokesman for 21st Century Fox declined to comment for this article. Through all of this, 21st Century Fox has taken steps to keep the allegations and settlements as quiet as possible. In addition to binding Dhue, Huddy and other women who have settled to silence through nondisclosure agreements, most full-time employees at Fox have arbitration agreements that \"force them into secret corporate courts,\" said Nancy Erika Smith, the attorney who represented Carlson. -\"Secrecy is what allows harassers to keep it up,\" she said. As a corporate matter, 21st Century Fox has made minimal public disclosures about the cost and extent of the problems. The company's entire official accounting of the Ailes drama is contained in a half-sentence buried in two quarterly 10Q reports, a financial disclosure document required by federal -securities law. \"For the three months ended September 30, 2016,\" the disclosure reads, \"the Company recorded . . . approximately $35 million of costs related to settlements of pending and potential litigations following the July 2016 resignation of the Chairman and CEO of Fox News Channel after a public complaint was filed containing allegations of sexual harassment.\" (The complaint referred to is Carlson's lawsuit.) The company has meanwhile kept its internal investigation of the Ailes and O'Reilly matters -under wraps. After Carlson filed suit, lawyers for the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison were hired to look into the complaint and Fox's workplace practices. 21st Century Fox called on the same firm this month after Wendy Walsh, a former contributor to O'Reilly's program, formally complained about O'Reilly on a company hotline. According to people at 21st Century Fox, the law firm's findings weren't contained in a written report. Instead, the lawyers presented their conclusions to the Murdochs in oral briefings, a step that would minimize leaks or unauthorized dissemination of a document. Lisa Bloom, an attorney for Walsh and two other women who have alleged harassment by O'Reilly, said 21st Century Fox's attorneys typically insist on some of the strictest nondisclosure terms in the business. \"Their strategy has been to duck and cover every time a woman complains of harassment in their workplace, and then to drive her out, pay her off and silence her,\" Bloom said. Attorneys Smith and Bloom both note that almost none of the women publicly identified as accusers continue to be employed by Fox. They also note a seemingly opposite fact: Many of the senior executives who were employed at the time Ailes and O'Reilly were allegedly harassing women continue to run Fox. Among them are Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy, who became co-presidents of Fox News after Ailes's departure. In her lawsuit, Tantaros said Shine warned her to drop her harassment complaints about Ailes or face a campaign of retaliation. [Now the hard work really starts for Fox News] A Fox contributor, Julie Roginsky, alleged in a lawsuit this month that Ailes repeatedly sexually harassed her and sabotaged her TV career after she refused his advances. She also named Shine in her suit, claiming that he retaliated against her when she refused to \"malign\" Carlson and join \"Team Roger\" after Carlson sued Ailes last year. Attorneys for Huddy, who settled her allegations, alleged in an intent-to-sue letter last year that Abernethy had harassed Huddy and harmed her TV career while he was the head of the Fox TV station group. In a statement, Briganti said the letter \"contains substantial falsehoods, which [Abernethy has] vehemently denied.\" She added that Shine denied the allegations in the Tantaros and Roginsky lawsuits. The pattern of allegations, settlements and secrecy at 21st Century Fox suggests a kind of \"organizational deviance\" in which multiple actors play a role, said Mark Feldstein, a University of Maryland journalism professor who is writing a book about media scandals, including the ones involving Ailes and O'Reilly. \"Essentially, the Murdochs made a business calculation as to how much and how long they could get away with all this before the price they had to pay was too great to bear,\" he said. \"It's not how [the parent company of] a news organization to supposed to behave. It's not how any company is supposed to act.\"",

            "body": "A man passes in front of a wall with a graffiti representing French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen and U.S. President Trump, and the lettering 'Pride and Prejudice', in Paris on April 8.  (Joel Saget/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) President Trump's apologists were convinced that the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch, the strikes on Syria and the mega-bomb dropped in Afghanistan signaled Trump had \"grown.\" He's learning on the job! He's coming back into the mainstream! As we've seen each and every time he showed signs of maturing, excitement over momentary improvement was vastly overblown. Consider this past week: Trump was uninformed or lied about the whereabouts of the USS Vinson, falsely suggesting the \"armada\" was heading for North Korea. While foreign observers and human rights groups deplored the irregularities in the Turkish election, Trump was on the phone to \"congratulate\" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a thuggish dictator in the making. As if his creepy affection for authoritarians were not plain for all to see, he cast his lot in the French elections with the anti-Muslim instigator Marine Le Pen, who gladly accepted millions from a Russian bank to finance her campaign. (She has also, in true National Front style, denied France's culpability in the roundup and shipment to death camps of French Jews in the 1940s. Holocaust minimization, if not outright denial, seems to be something these fascistic populists share.)  He insisted that she is the \"strongest on borders, and she's the strongest on what's been going on in France.\" So much for American moral leadership. His hapless Attorney General Jeff Sessions insulted the federal judge (\"sitting on an island in the Pacific\") who enjoined Trump's unconstitutional travel ban. Sessions was also forced to backtrack after his department stupidly called New York City \"soft on crime.\" This is all part of the administration's false and racist claim that America is in the midst of a crime wave caused by undocumented immigrants. Trump first insisted, and then seemed to back off the assertion, that Republicans would have a new health-care bill to roll out this upcoming week. He apparently exaggerated his readiness to present a tax reform bill. (\"The White House will release on Wednesday the 'broad principles and priorities' of their plans to overhaul federal taxes, a White House official said Friday night, downplaying expectations that the Trump administration would reveal key details underpinning the plan.\") And sensing he was about to get a failing grade on his first 100 days, Trump called the calendar tracking \"ridiculous,\" the telltale sign of a president who has accomplished less than any president, with the exceptions of William Henry Harrison and James Garfield (who both died soon after taking office). He's tried without success to bully Congress into paying for his wall, something not a single border-state lawmaker favors. (\"Most lawmakers representing the region-both Democrats and Republicans-said they are opposed and many said they have unanswered questions. A few were noncommittal, but not a single member of the House or Senate representing the region expressed support for the funding request. That includes nine members of the House and eight senators across four states: Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California.\") No, Trump has not improved nor has his administration become competent or coherent. He wildly exaggerates accomplishments, overpromises and delivers virtually nothing. He embraces anti-democratic and racist autocrats. And his administration remains obsessed with vilifying immigrants and creating hysteria about our southern border. Meanwhile, his major legislative initiatives have not passed even one chamber of Congress. Michael Crowley writes that Trump's embrace of Erdogan and Le Pen \"reignited alarms in Europe and the U.S. about Trump's commitment to the continent's key institutions-including the European Union and the NATO alliance-after several weeks of reassuring signals from Trump and his top officials.\" Crowley quotes Thomas Wright of the Brookings Institution as saying, \"He can't help himself. It shows that he's never going to normalize. He's been told to behave, he's gotten briefings and met [European] leaders. But now something's happened and he can't restrain himself.\" Unfortunately, Trump can only keep up the pretense of normalcy for so long. Each time his fans boast of a change, his facade of sobriety melts. He'll continue to be a menace to the United States and the West so long as he is in office.",

            "body": "(Reuters/Mike Segar) The discussion over who is to blame for Hillary Clinton's 2016 loss to Donald Trump has suddenly flared up again. A New York Times report this weekend reveals new details about FBI director James Comey's decision to reveal newly discovered emails that ultimately proved irrelevant - yet had a large impact on the election's outcome. The Times report makes Comey's intervention look even more suspect, particularly in light of his refusal to divulge anything about the ongoing investigation into possible Trump campaign collusion with Russian efforts to tip the election to Trump. The chatter about the Clinton campaign's failures has also escalated with the publication of \"Shattered,\" a new book about the election. I tried to parse out some of what happened, and who is to blame for it, in a piece I wrote for a new collection of essays about Campaign 2016. A slightly-edited excerpt from the essay is below. ******************************************************************************* What happened? Most people agree on one thing about the 2016 election: That the simplest way to describe what happened is that demographics did not deliver for Democrats. The party and the Clinton campaign had good reason to be confident that the vaunted \"Obama coalition\" - the nonwhites, young voters, single women, and college-educated whites who powered majority victories in the two previous national elections - would come through one more time, as Republicans had shown no signs of even trying to evolve culturally in sync with the preoccupations of those groups. But demographic destiny fell short of swamping Trump's margins among blue-collar and middle-income whites. Some critics now argue that this was the result of a crucial mistake on Clinton's part. Clinton, goes this argument, failed to connect with the economic anxieties of these white voters precisely because overconfidence in her demographic advantage led her campaign to get lost amid micro-targeted cultural appeals to various groups in the Obama coalition, thus neglecting a broader economic and reform message. The oft heard refrain is that Clinton's initial economic push - for shared prosperity and an economy that works for all - got overtaken by \"identity politics,\" which is to say, by the Clinton team's decision to spend a great deal of time and resources on attacking Trump's racially charged campaign, rather than on beating him in the argument over the economy and the need for political reform. There may be some truth to the notion that Clinton de-emphasized her economic message in a damaging way. Although Clinton's convention speech was heavily laden with a programmatic economic agenda, political scientist Lynn Vavreck conducted a post-election analysis of the TV advertising by both campaigns and concluded that more than three-quarters of the appeals in Clinton's ads were about character traits. Only 9 percent were about jobs or the economy. In contrast, more than one-third of the appeals in Trump's ads were focused on economic issues, such as jobs, taxes, and trade. And some Democratic operatives have groused that the Clinton camp was overly confident of victory in reliably Democratic Rust Belt states like Wisconsin and Michigan - meaning, perhaps, that Trump's economic message had even more resonance in them than the Clinton team had anticipated. But Comey did matter. Yes, Comey mattered - a lot It's strange that people are even debating this point. After all, just after the election, it was widely established that top officials in both the Clinton and Trump campaigns saw Comey's announcement of newly-discovered emails as a \"game changer.\" For instance, see this piece from Politico's Glenn Thrush, which reported that to be the case. Thrush noted that Clinton's chief data analytics guru saw her numbers tank among a crucial demographic: educated white voters who had been alienated by Trump's videotaped boasts of lewd groping and subsequent allegations of unwanted advances. Meanwhile, elections analyst Nate Silver concluded that without Comey and the Russia hacking, states like Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania - which Trump won by excruciatingly tight margins - might have tipped to Clinton. \"Comey had a large, measurable impact on the race,\" Silver said. In other words, if Comey had never taken that step, we might currently be discussing the staying power of the Obama coalition and the success of the Clinton strategy - in particular, the emphasis on attacking Trump's dangerously unhinged temperament, and his campaign of racism, hate, and abuse directed at Mexican immigrants and women - in driving college-educated whites into the Democratic camp. It is often argued that Comey is not responsible for Clinton's loss, because he did not force her to set up a private server, or de-emphasize her economic message, or neglect the Rust Belt. But this argument is weak. It can be true that Clinton was a very flawed candidate who made mistakes, even as it is also true that Comey's letter had a major impact on the outcome - and potentially a decisive one - without which the Clinton strategy might have prevailed. Given that the Comey revelations ended up amounting to nothing in substantive terms, the fact that his decision did have such a large impact reveals his handling of the whole mess to be indefensible and reflects terribly on our political process. Clinton's real failings should not be permitted to minimize the significance of that. It was not unreasonable for the Clinton team to conclude that the strategy of casting Trump as temperamentally unfit to handle national security - and too hateful and divisive to lead our diverse country - was going to succeed. Polls indicated for months that Clinton was on track to become the first Democrat to win a majority of college-educated whites in over half a century. Many analysts across the spectrum had concluded that such an outcome would probably cripple Trump's ability to prevail by running up enormous margins among white voters. And whatever the Clinton team's motives in making a big issue out of Trump's race-tinged campaign, it was the right thing to do. For all the talk about Clinton playing \"identity politics,\" the candidate who played \"identity politics\" to a far greater extent was Donald Trump. His campaign - which fused the relentless scapegoating of Muslims and undocumented immigrants with revanchist appeals to \"Make America Great Again\" - was all about encouraging and playing to a sense that white identity and white America were under siege. It was important for the country that Clinton call out Trump's white nationalist appeals for what they were - and that she defend the minority groups that he had targeted for vilification. Not doing so would have been an abdication. None of this, however, should absolve the Clinton campaign and the Democratic establishment figures who rallied to her side from facing a reckoning over the ways in which they are responsible for the outcome. Here's where Clinton, her campaign and Democratic officials failed One of the Clinton campaign's official public explanations for her loss is that she ultimately came to be seen as a creature of the establishment at a moment when the electorate craved change. Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook has described this as a \"head wind\" that could not be overcome. Of course, if that is true, then Clinton herself - and Democratic establishment figures - are partially complicit in creating that perception. In retrospect, the early decision to limit the number of debates - a decision, as I reported at the time, that the Democratic National Committee made in part out of deference to the Clinton campaign, which apparently wanted to limit her exposure - may have been an early signal of an unhealthy establishment faith in Clinton's chances. So too was the lack of more primary challengers, which appeared premised on the sense that she could not be beaten precisely because she was the pick of so many party leaders. To be sure, it was reasonable for many leading Democrats to suspect that Clinton - with her deep knowledge and experience - gave the party a very good shot at winning the White House. Whether this assumption was subjected to rigorous enough scrutiny - and whether a failure in that regard represented a more systemic problem with the party establishment, such as overconfidence in its ability to win national elections - should be topics of debate in coming months. Another question that must be settled is whether the Clinton campaign - and establishment Democrats - reckoned seriously enough with polling that revealed abysmal public perceptions of her on trust and honesty, and widespread concern with her handling of her emails and the Clinton Foundation. Taken together, all of this amounted to a red flag - a warning that Clinton might not be seen as a credible messenger if the campaign became a battle over who would shake up our corrupt political system, as Trump sought to turn it into. Clinton rolled out a detailed political reform agenda, but it's not clear whether she conveyed a gut sense that she really wanted to shake things up. As one Democrat sighed to me in August: I wish Clinton would show more discomfort with our political system and with how business is done in Washington. This possibility - that Clinton did not show a gut level of discomfort with our current arrangements - is worth mulling. Trump's numbers were even worse than Clinton's on honesty, and his promises to bust up the system were crude and laughably absurd - he actually argued that he was well qualified to reform our corrupt system because he had milked it himself from the inside to great effect. But it's worth asking whether he somehow conveyed a visceral disdain for the way business is done in Washington that Clinton simply did not. Of course, even if one accepts that Clinton failed to marshal effective enough messages on the economy and political reform, it's hard to know how much that mattered. The polling evidence is mixed on whether Clinton's economic message even failed - exit polls showed she won among voters most concerned about the economy in many swing states. Clinton won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, and her extremely close losses in multiple states might not have happened if turnout had shaped up differently even on the margins. Some of the post-election debate has been framed around a false choice Beyond this, if the party is going to work to sharpen up its economic and reform message - to working-class white voters in particular - the crucial challenge is how to do this without backing off of its commitment to being the party that fully embraces cultural and demographic change. Much of the post-election debate is on some basic level framed around a false choice - one pitting the need to minister to the Obama coalition versus the need for economic appeals to working-class whites. But these things needn't be in conflict with one another. The challenges faced by the nonwhites, young voters, and women who make up the Obama coalition are also in many respects economic ones. Debates over systemic racism, over how to create more opportunity and mobility for minorities and young people, over how to integrate undocumented immigrants who have been contributing to American life for years but remain consigned to the shadows, and over how to foster economic equality for women - all of these are, at bottom, about the need for reforms that make the economy fairer and render prosperity more inclusive, for everyone. Most early indications are that senior Democrats are not falling into the trap that this false choice debate presents. Most of the chatter among Democrats is how to refocus the party's message on economic fairness in ways that have appeal across diverse constituencies. That will likely continue. The Democratic Party is a diverse party. It should not weaken its commitment to defending minority rights, particularly in an age of resurgent Trump Era white backlash. The party must not back off of its defense of undocumented immigrants - both for substantive and strategic reasons. If Trump makes good on his promises, the plight of undocumented immigrants could worsen into a genuine humanitarian crisis, one that Democrats must resist. The GOP will continue alienating the fast growing demographic of Latino voters, potentially hastening Democratic gains in Sun Belt states, which, over time, could reconfigure the map in advantageous ways in future national elections. This time around, demographic destiny did not materialize for Democrats. But demographic change marches on. While that is by no means alone a guarantee of future success, the party's big challenge going forward will be to work to maintain its position on the right side of it - while also speaking more effectively to the anxieties of those who feel it is leaving them behind. ********************************************************************** Excerpted from \"Trumped: The Election that Broke All the Rules\" (Rowman & Littlefield, 2017).

We want a celebrity, we want someone who will tell us whatever we want to hear, in fact in Trump's case, he didn't even have to do that, he just said Make America Great Again, and we could all envision for ourselves what would make it great again, for us.  He painted our nation as falling apart and then told us all that he (and ONLY he) could or would fix it.  He used Wikileaks and RT and spouted whatever BS was in them.  He used Divide and Conquer with Hillary against Bernie (and Bernie did enough of that for him, painting her as a crook, which Trump picked up).  He told us lies about the unemployment rate, (it was, after all, only 4.7%) but made it out like everyone was out of work, then lied about the reasons why people really are out of work (all China's fault, all Mexico's fault) instead of admitting the reality of automation and market forces, and then told us he'd get rid of all the Mexicans and anyone else that was \"taking advantage of us\".  He used the Black Lives Matter movement to appeal to whites that secretly believe all black people are criminals.  He used the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino to scare us into believing we needed to ban Muslims, even though none of the attacks since 9-11 have been by foreigners.  And being a Reality TV Star (NOT a businessman, at ALL), the cable and network shows hung on every word and every breath.  You couldn't turn on your TV without being inundated.

            "body": "White House Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) Top Trump administration officials are giving out differing accounts of a tax plan that the president has promised will be released Wednesday, calling into question whether they have ironed out some of the most difficult components of any proposal. Among the major decisions President Trump and his party face on taxes is whether to go for a short-term tax cut that keeps much of the existing tax code intact but reduces rates or whether to go for a more fundamental shift that makes long-term changes to how the government collects revenue. Putting in place long-term changes to the tax code would give businesses certainty to help guide their investment decisions, but these sorts of changes to the tax code are much more difficult politically, as they would require bipartisan support. On Saturday, administration officials offered confusing signals on which route Trump would pursue. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Saturday suggested Wednesday's announcement would pursue a long-term overhaul of the tax code. Mnuchin said one of the White House's top priorities was to complete \"comprehensive economic tax reform,\" dramatically simplifying how people file their annual returns. He said he wants to allow many people to file their taxes on a \"postcard.\" But on Sunday, Mick Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, appeared to cast doubt on Mnuchin's statements, saying the White House hadn't decided whether to pursue a long-term or short-term tax overhaul. He also said they haven't decided whether to offset the rate cuts with other changes that would reduce the budget deficit. \"I don't think we've decided that part yet,\" Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday. \"You can either have a small tax cut that's permanent or a large tax cut that's short-term.\" Mulvaney said the tax plan the White House will release Wednesday will include \"some specific governing principles, some guidance, also some indication of what the rates are going to be.\" For his part, Trump on Saturday wrote on Twitter that \"Big TAX REFORM AND TAX REDUCTION will be announced next Wednesday.\" Trump surprised Capitol Hill - and even some people within the White House - when he first announced the Wednesday deadline at an event last week. But even while he has promised the announcement will prove to be the starting point of tax reform, advisers have cautioned that it will offer broad outlines and leave some key questions unanswered. The president has said an overhaul of the tax code is one of his biggest priorities, but top advisers have refused to provide details so far of how he will usher in the biggest tax cut in U.S. history - which he has promised - without piling on trillions of dollars in new federal debt. He has said cutting taxes will grow the economy, lead to more hiring and bring trillions of dollars back into the United States that companies are now holding overseas to avoid taxation. Among the administration's stated aims are to simplify the tax code for individuals and families, lower corporate tax rates and provide a major tax cut for the middle class. Mnuchin, one of the key architects of the White House plan, also said that some ways of measuring the impact of the tax cuts would find that it would grow the debt in the \"short term.\" Budget experts have forecast that Trump's proposal could boost the economy but also dramatically expand the deficit because trillions of dollars in revenue would be lost over 10 years. When asked about the deficit impact of the tax plan, Mnuchin said at an International Monetary Fund event Saturday that when accounting for the economic growth that would occur because of the tax changes, the tax overhaul \"will pay\" for itself. But he also said that if these macroeconomic changes aren't factored in, the tax plan would grow the deficit. An analysis that doesn't factor in economic growth forecasts is called a \"static\" assessment. \"Under static scoring, there will be some short-term issues,\" Mnuchin said. Factoring in the macroeconomic impact of tax cuts is very controversial because it is very difficult to do. A number of conservative budget experts - including key congressional aides who write tax law - have said that the White House has an overly rosy view of what the economic impact of its tax cuts would be. The deficit impact of tax cuts is vitally important because any plan that grows the deficit over the long term is much more difficult to pass through Congress. It would take a number of Democrats to support such a plan because Republicans only have 52 seats in the Senate. They would need at least 60 votes to get such a tax measure through. A tax plan that increases the deficit only in the short term needs only a majority Senate vote. During the campaign, Trump proposed to reduce the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. He also proposed collapsing the seven personal income tax brackets into three, with rates of 12 percent, 25 percent and 33 percent, based on income levels. The proposal would also increase the standard tax deduction for individuals and married couples filing jointly. He also wants to eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax. Trump has also proposed some sort of \"reciprocity\" tax that would hit imports from countries that have taxes or tariffs on U.S. exports. 1 of 95 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 See what President Trump has been doing since taking office View Photos The beginning of his term has featured controversial executive orders and frequent conflicts with the media.

That is because as a \"foreign tax subject\" I have no right to exemptions (those were abolished anyway in the Dutch system),deductions, or tax credits (that now partially take the place of exemptions). I pay Dutch tax on every last cent of my income. And I hate it! Where is the fun in making charitable donations if you can't deduct them, for instance?

The bulk of the economy is from the larger lower to middle class who actually spend money for clothing, food etc.  More $$ in their pockets = additional spending.   Tax rates on Ubers should go up and take away the loophole for those traders who claim it so they only pay 15% rather than the full tax rate on their \"earnings\".

It's now been 90 days since Trump took office, so Politico checked in on the matter. They found that not only is there no report, but that neither the White House national security team nor Trump cybersecurity adviser Rudy Giuliani appear to have even been working on one.\"",

(Alessandra Tarantino/AP) Rhetorically speaking, comparing someone to Adolf Hitler is usually the nuclear option in policy and polite discussions alike. An opponent's viewpoints can be outlandish, harmful or downright wrong - and still a far cry from the slave labor and extermination of 6 million Jews. But what happens when it's the pope making the Nazi allusion? Pope Francis, no stranger to lending his moral authority to a range of causes, was meeting with some migrants at the Basilica of St. Bartholomew in Rome on Saturday, according to the BBC, and relayed a story about a Middle Eastern refugee whose wife was killed by Islamist militants for holding on to her crucifix. \"I don't know if he managed to leave that concentration camp,\" the pope said. \"Because many of them are concentration ... because there is a great number of people left there inside them.\" As the pontiff's words rocketed around the world, the American Jewish Committee, an advocate for Jewish causes, released a statement saying it understood the pontiff's sentiments but didn't agree with his comparison. \"The conditions in which migrants are currently living in some European countries may well be difficult, and deserve still greater international attention, but concentration camps they certainly are not,\" AJC chief executive David Harris said in the statement on the group's website. \"The Nazis and their allies erected and used concentration camps for slave labor and the extermination of millions of people during World War II. There is no comparison to the magnitude of that tragedy.\" [How Pope Francis is leading the Catholic Church against anti-migrant populism] \"We respectfully urge the Pope to reconsider his regrettable choice of words,\" Harris added. \"Precision of language and facts is absolutely essential when making any historical reference, all the more so when coming from such a prominent and admired world figure.\" According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are 65.3 million forcibly displaced people across the world. Of the 21.3 million refugees in the world, half are children. The Calais camp for migrants in northern France, nicknamed \"the Jungle,\" had \"cramped makeshift tents plagued by rats, water sources contaminated by (feces) and inhabitants suffering from tuberculosis, scabies and post-traumatic stress,\" the Guardian reported. And in Greece, Interior Minister Panagiotis Kouroumblis, touring the Idomeni camp on the border with Macedonia, compared it to a concentration camp. Idomeni was where a photo emerged of two Syrian parents washing their newborn baby, Bayan, in a puddle. Newborn baby washed in a cold muddy puddle.

Last summer, he gave Catholic priests the authority to forgive women who've had abortions. He has rejected the idea of same-sex marriage, but he has encouraged priests to be merciful when dealing with divorced and remarried couples. He said destroying the environment is a sin. He has spoken out on migrant issues again and again, emphasizing that it's incumbent on all Christians to help refugees and others who are struggling, as Jesus said in Matthew 25. Last year, after a flood of anti-immigrant sentiment in the wake of a terrorist attack in Brussels, Francis washed the feet of immigrants at a center for asylum seekers in Rome. Pope Francis celebrated Holy Thursday in 2016 by washing the feet of 11 refugees - four Nigerian Catholics, three Christians from Eritrea, three Muslims from Syria, Pakistan and Mali, and one Indian Hindu - at a housing facility on the outskirts of Rome. (The Vatican) \"It's hypocrisy to call yourself a Christian and chase away a refugee or someone seeking help, someone who is hungry or thirsty, toss out someone who is in need of my help,\" he said while meeting with pilgrims in October, according to Catholic News Services. \"If I say I am Christian, but do these things, I'm a hypocrite.\" Read more: 'He used us, he stole from us': Man jailed for impersonating a Catholic priest - again Idaho priest accused of sexually assaulting airman is free from jail without bail Infertile couples came to this 'baby god' for help.

The Jews accepted the partition, the Arab armies of 6 nations attacked.\n\nActually this was not the first partition of Palestine. That occurred in 1922, when the British gave 77% of Mandatory Palestine (so proclaimed by the LEague of Nations, predecessor to the UN) to the Arabs to form the modern nation of Jordan, where Jews were forbidden to live.\n\nWhen Jordan illegally annexed East Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria in 1950  (renaming it the West Bank for the first time in history), they expelled all the Jews. All 58 synagogues in East Jerusalem were destroyed, Jewish cemeteries were vandalized and headstones used to pave the streets, and Jews were denied access to their holy sites.\n\nSo apparently you have no problem with Jews being expelled from East Jerusalem and the West Bank, but you have a problem with them returning?\n\nAs for the right of Israel to occupy the West Bank, that's granted by UN 242, which calls for Israel to occupy until:\n\n\"Termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every State in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries free from threats or acts of force.\"\n\nSomething the Palestinians are utterly uninterested in.", 
                "Furthermore, it was never envisioned that Israel would withdraw from all of the West Bank. Lord Caradon, the primary architect of UN 242 explains in an interview:\n\nJournal of Palestine Studies, \u201cAn Interview with Lord Caradon,\u201d Spring - Summer 1976, pgs 144-45:\n\nQ. The basis for any settlement will be United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, of which you were the architect. Would you say there is a contradiction between the part of the resolution that stresses the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and that which calls for Israeli withdrawal from \u201coccupied territories,\u201d but not from \u201cthe occupied territories\u201d?\n\nA. I defend the resolution as it stands. What it states, as you know, is first the general principle of inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war. That means that you can\u2019t justify holding onto territory merely because you conquered it. We could have said: well, you go back to the 1967 line. But I know the 1967 line, and it\u2019s a rotten line. You couldn\u2019t have a worse line for a permanent international boundary. It\u2019s where the troops happened to be on a certain night in 1948. It\u2019s got no relation to the needs of the situation.\n\nHad we said that you must go back to the 1967 line, which would have resulted if we had specified a retreat from all the occupied territories, we would have been wrong.",

Bernie Sanders, center, listens as Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks during the final day of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 28, 2016. (Tannen Maury/EPA) You might not be surprised if I were to tell you that a majority of Americans think that President Trump is out of touch with the concerns of most people in the United States today. Sure, he won the election, but a plurality of voters opposed him, and a new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that he hasn't expanded his base of support significantly since then. You certainly wouldn't be surprised to learn that there's a broad partisan split on the question, as there is on nearly everything in politics these days. Only 1 in 10 of those who voted for Trump in November think he's out of touch - but 90 percent of Hillary Clinton voters do. Partisan views are slightly more moderate, with 20 percent of Republicans and 87 percent of Democrats holding that position. When it comes to the Republican Party, the numbers are a bit worse. Sixty-two percent of Americans, and 30 percent of Republicans themselves, think that the GOP is out of touch with the concerns of most people in the United States. But none of this means that Democrats are seen as echoing the concerns of the common man. In fact, the Democratic Party is viewed as more out of touch than either Trump or the party's political opponents. Two-thirds of Americans think the Democrats are out of touch - including nearly half of Democrats themselves. It's worth highlighting that last point. While the political opposition generally views Trump or either party as about equally out of touch - with about 80 to 90 percent saying so - the Democratic Party is viewed as far more out of touch by Democrats than Trump or the GOP are by Republicans. Last week, we noted that Trump's party is seen as more divided than the opposition, according to data from the Pew Research Center. Sixty-eight percent of Americans think the Republican Party is more divided than united, including 57 percent of Republicans. Most Democrats, by contrast, say their party is united. How does that comport with the findings from the Post-ABC poll? It's tricky to determine, certainly, but one way may be that a large chunk of Democrats feel that their party is united in a vision ... that's at odds with the concerns of the American public. That would certainly align with the main tension in the party, between the vision of supporters of Bernie Sanders and that of Clinton backers - which was made manifest during last year's Democratic primary. Some portion of this, too, is probably a function of Clinton's loss in November (as is the shift in how people say they would have changed their vote). But it's clear that the Democratic Party is cognizant, to some extent, of the discontent at the grass roots. When Tom Perez, the newly elected leader of the party, headed out on a listening tour this month, he brought along a special guest: Sanders.",

                "Interesting, but very shallow article.\n\nWhat would be useful is to know why people are specifically dissatisfied with the parties and the president.\n\nOnly then might we work towards addressing the issues of dissatisfaction.\n\nPlease, pollsters and reporters, provide us with the details.", 
                "My assessment:\n\nThe Republicans have an aggressive platform that is authoritarian, mean, fixed on money as the end all/be all, fend for yourselves through strength, wolves in sheeps clothing con the quiet, self branded as the only patriots.  They play mean and sneaky, strategic, offensively.  The many good are overshadowed by the minority.  They have the market on the military, law enforcement, and religious conservatives.  The ultra conservatives have high jacked the party from the moderates. Dump McConnell.\n\nDemocrats are the flower children, live and let live group, see money/taxes as an opportunity to improve situation for all, lend others a hand.  They find down and dirty campaigning distasteful, want lofty discussion, let's talk rather than fight.  They have the idealists, educated, intellectuals, teachers, environmentalists, scientists, union, govt./public workers.  Too may democrat officeholders are unwilling to fight on principle and have let the older leaders dominate.  Time for new blood. Dump Pelosi.\n\nThat said, the Democrats need to grow some XXXX.  They failed to back Obama at his re-election and midterms, when they should have been a strong voice for health care achievements as well as reminding the nation of the economic gains from the brink of disaster after total Republican obstructionism. Push for low and middle class gains as long term good for all, the women/lgbt/minorities, etc. is not pushing these lifestyles on others, it  just mean equal rights for all. Push on healthcare, student loans, worker training, VA reform, infrastructure, environment, fair taxes. Fight.  Stop blaming Hillary or Obama and step up.", 
                "No surprise here. The Democratic leadership continue to believe people will vote for Democrats simply because they aren't Republicans. No dice, we want progressive candidates with ideas and principle. How many Democrats are really out front on Climate Change? This is not just another issue that Democrats can occasionally express concern about.", 
                "And almost two-thirds (62%) think the Republicans are out of touch.  Possibly within the margin of error of one another.", 
                "Am I out of touch? No, it's the voters who are wrong.", 
                "Especially out of touch with the farmers (just look at all those red states smack in the middle of the nation) that they were charter members of the FDR coalition and the backbone of the Democratic Party should not be forgotten.    Without them the Dems will not be NATIONAL party.", 
                "The farmers are an absolutely insignificant voting group right now because too few are left.  Corporate farming dominates, a huge change from the 1930s.  It was unions that became the backbone after the war and that held until Reagan started breaking them up.  Even the rural south became a service (and non-union labor) economy.", 
                "It seems that the left ties all of its issues together, and they make it difficult to support one without supporting all. Case in point. I've received e-mails from the Sierra Club director that refer to support of gay rights. We are told that we cannot support women's rights unless we support gay rights, illegal immigrants rights, TG rights, Islamic rights, etc.", 
                "Mr. Bump- Can you please explain to me when the Democrat Party became the Democratic Party. I don't believe that to be grammatically correct, as in the Republican Party cannot be referred to as the Republicanic Party.  Also, by the nature, definition and activities of the Democrat Party there is nothing democratic about it. I look forward to your response.", 
                "The Republican Party leadership has always referred to the opposing party as the Democratic Party.  It is only in recent years that childish Republican leaders began using the term Democrat Party.  Why?  Because, Democratic might somehow sound, shall we say, democratic or American.", 
                "It's ironic that the Republican Party is \"out of touch\" because they keep trying to do  what they promise to do (take health coverage away from millions of people, for example) while Democrats are out of touch because they seem to have forgotten what they stand for and have drifted into the arms of lobbyists and the Washington Establishment. To change and be more in touch, Republicans would have to abandon their core policy solutions. Democrats, in contrast, need to remember what the party has ostensibly stood for since the days of FDR.", 
                "How can a party that almost never talks about how government is burdensome ever truly be \"in touch\" with most Americans?  The Dems have to get off the idea that a government solution is necessary to every problem and have to communicate concern with bureaucratic overreach. . . And this from a registered Democrat!", 
                "Imperfect though they are, the Democrats, Sanders wing or Clinton wing -- doesn't matter - are all we've got.  However \"out of touch\" anyone thinks the Democrats are, the Republicans are far, far worse by any measure imaginable.  A foolish collection of ridiculous fools steeped in corruption and avarice.", 
                "The democrats should keep running on their excellent 2016 platform.  They should constantly tell the public what they planned to do for the country and what Trump and the republicans are doing.\n     No more circular firing squads, please.", 
                "2/3?  That IS being kind.", 
                "If you're left of center, I'd love a suggestion of what you can offer that has a better chance of winning. Suggest some concrete and reasonable improvements instead of the constant junior high school level berating of Sanders and Hillary. Neither Trump nor some greedy Libertarian counts.",

                "Imposing will others over birth control?  That is definitely Republican territory.  They are the ones defunding, challenging eligibility, imposing permission from parents and partners, etc.  The Democrats are saying - go talk to your doctor and make a decision, leave government out of it. You have it backwards.", 
                "The wish of mine that Democrats in particular would return to New Deal Liberalism seems all but impossible today, not only because the will of the people who actually pull the strings, namely those who finance candidates, is not there; but also because that very same burden, the financial cost of a political campaign, is far too high.  Everyone with common sense can see this, yet apparently the Roberts Court cannot see it, and hence we got the abysmal Citizens United ruling that overturned over 100 years of campaign finance reform.  Since the advent of television, and the rising importance of other mass mediums, political candidates have been hard-pressed to get the necessary financing to run for office without first kowtowing to the \"soft\" economic power of the commercial sphere.  This turn of misfortune has resulted in a government that is led around the nose by the commercial sector to the point we go to war to make the petroleum industry happy, the arms manufacturers happy.  Then we end up with nobody happy.  \n\nThe commonly offered suggestion that network and major cable news networks donate time for political candidates as a duty towards the public interest is always laughed out of the arena because those powerful media monstrosities are making way too much money off commercials and such.  \n\nAs a result our politicians are forced into making nice with a very small minority of Americans, the rest of us feel it, and then propagandists get involved and blame the government.  \n\nI remain convinced the biggest threat to what's left of democracy in America is capitalism.  Too much capitalism.  Either capitalism is top dog or democracy is top dog.  With the former, we end-up with fascism.  \n\nAs for the Democrats losing so badly in down-ballot elections, it certainly didn't help that the GOP's all-too-partisan redistricting in 2010, pretty much the same thing as robbing a bank or mugging a pedestrian, managed to mangle accurate outcomes for partisan want.", 
                "Bernie was Trump's WILLING tool. He ran against Democrats, never against republicans. He invaded a political party he wasn't part of and got his butt handed to him by VOTERS.", 
                "The party became a \"Muddle of the Road\" party, with its clearest vision that of an entitled Clinton family, evidenced by her Goldman Sachs speeches and private e-mail server, which prompted the Comey investigation.  \n\nWeighed down by her mistakes and a campaign led by arrogant, wet behind the ears number crunchers, she was an easy target for Trump, abetted by the Kremlin. \n\nI believe she would have been a good President though I shudder at the damage Robbie Mook could have done to her administration. But Hillary Clinton needs to make clear that was, as she reportedly said, her \"last campaign\".  Then and only then, can  she have a positive influence on  the national debate.   \n\nRun her again and Clinton will become a modern version of William Jennings Bryan and Henry Clay, always a candidate, never a president. \n\nBernie is correct; the party must renew itself behind a sensible populist program. That means, among many things, open primaries.  Had the Democrats not stacked the deck against Sanders, he may not have beaten Clinton; we'll never know.   But if he had won, it seems fairly clear his intelligent populism would have trumped the Donald's ersatz version.  That doesn't mean he should be the candidate in 2020, only that Bernie has earned the right to lead the progressive reformation.", 
                "Yes, those are the talking points.  Y'all in the Bernie camp and all those with Trump did a wonderful job demonizing Hillary as a corrupt, warmongering corporatist woman.  A nice victory on your part.  Do you ever wonder what Hillary might really be like?  I doubt it.", 
                "I lived in DC during the Clinton regime. Having talked to a number of people who worked at the White House at the time, to a person they all said she was a mean nasty person ... unless you could do something for her. They did, however, say Bill was a pretty nice guy.", 
                "\"entitled Clinton family, evidenced by her Goldman Sachs speeches\" You know about those speeches and how much she was paid because unlike the TAX LIAR, Bernie Sanders, her taxes are an open book.\nWhy did Bernie LIE about his taxes? What was he hiding?\nIf he was so good, why did he lose by 4 MILLION votes?", 
                "\"All politics is local.\"  If you're running for dog catcher or Congress the only litmus test is do you get the majority of the votes in your district?  Abortion rights and wrongs are strongly held personal beliefs.  If you're willing to cut off your relationship with your daughter/mother/sister over their attitude on reproductive rights alone, that's your problem.  Democrats need to win local contests for schools, roads, social services, and on and on.  Democrats need to NOT make litmus tests like reproductive rights  the enemy these other big issues.",

This in my mind would help counter the damage to the middle-class that has happened over the last 3 decades following Reagan's tax cuts/trickle-down laws.  When I looked at the economic analyses of the Dem's vs Trump's respective plans, the Dem's looked a lot more sensible and better regarding our national debt.  The foci that Dems need to repeat in 2018 and 2020 are the training programs they had proposed for workers transitioning from fossil-fuel-based industries to green energy jobs/technologies.  This HAS to occur, better now than later, because fossil fuel supplies will be depleted, regardless of whether one believes or not in global warming.  The Dems need to keep the verbiage on caring for the working American of the future, and this demands changes today.  The few thousand coal miners and steel workers Trump may have helped is just a short-term thing because these types of workers will ultimately have to transition to new green-energy jobs/technologies.  We can't pretend we are living in 1917--it is 2017 and we need to be pushing the jobs that are consistent with energy trends, while protecting environmental concerns.

            "body": "Some of the new styles of hotel robes that are featured at chains including Hilton, Marriott and Caesars Entertainment. (Standard Textile) Most hotel rooms are a blur, says Maxwell Young. But there is one part of his stay at the Hotel Palomar in Northwest Washington that he will always remember: the leopard- and zebra-print robes hanging in his room. \"It was like I opened the closet and rays of sunshine poured out,\" he said of the bathrobes, which he later raved about on Twitter. (\"Snow may have put a crimp in our DC plans, but this zebra robe at @Kimpton Palomar Hotel is really lifting my mood.\") Young, who works in marketing, spent the rest of his business trip working in his animal print robes. By checkout time, he'd made plans to buy a similar robe for a friend. As hotel chains look for new ways to attract younger travelers, bathrobes have become one more way to add pizazz to an otherwise predictable stay. Gone are the one-size-fits-all robes of earlier decades. In their place: Seer-sucker, houndstooth and periwinkle blue, all perfectly suited for sharing on social media. \"It's no longer just about putting the hotel logo on a floppy, loosefitting white robe,\" said Greg Eubanks, vice president of hospitality at Standard Textile, where robe sales to such companies as Marriott International and Hilton Hotels & Resorts have tripled in the past two years. These days, he said, the company's robes have sewn-in belts and pockets deep enough to hold smartphones. They're slimmer, too, and tend to be shorter. \"For years, we sold robes that were about operational efficiency,\" Eubanks said. \"These days, guests want to feel special - sexy, even - in their robes.\" To that end, executives at Four Seasons Hotels spent three years fine-tuning the chain's newest offerings, which are more tailored and less bulky than their predecessors. They also have slimmer sleeves to make it easier for women to style their hair in their robes. (\"We know customers are pleased because so many of our robes walk away,\" one executive said.) Marriott, meanwhile, has replaced many of its white robes with charcoal gray versions that are shorter and have wider sleeves. And at Hilton - where 18 percent of guests say that \"lounging around in hotel robes all day\" is their favorite part of being on vacation - lighter-weight resort robes have taken the place of plush terry. [Change the lights, redo the mirror: Hotels use fake rooms to test ideas] Perhaps the boldest bathrobes can be found in Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants' 65 properties. For 15 years, the San Francisco-based company has stocked its guests' rooms with leopard-, -giraffe- and zebra-print robes. Now it is going a step further, introducing a dozen new patterns and designs to its boutique properties, which include the Hotel George and Carlyle Hotel in Washington. The Hotel Monaco in Philadelphia, for example, now has Rocky Balboa-inspired hooded robes, while rooms at the Buchanan Hotel near San Francisco's Japantown come with kimono-style robes. In New Orleans, guests are greeted with seersucker robes. Other hotels carry herringbone and pinstriped prints as well as robes with hoods and shawl collars. \"As we developed more unique properties, we thought robes should become more interesting as well,\" said Diana Martinez, Kimpton's design director. \"It seems like a small detail, but it makes a big impact for guests.\" Finding the right bathrobes can, however, be a years-long challenge for hotels. The pieces must be durable enough to withstand commercial washing and inexpensive enough to replace fairly frequently. That means knitted fabrics like jersey and chenille, which can easily fall apart in the wash or stretch out on a hanger, are out, says Karen Faul, president of Monarch Cypress Hotel Division, which sells 250,000 hotel robes a year. \"Most robes you buy at the store would not withstand commercial washing,\" Faul said. \"We're talking intense pressure, high heat, stressful conditions multiple times a week. Even something like polyester you have to be careful with, because it'll melt if you crank up the dryer.\" [5 ways the hotel of the future is already here] Guest robes are washed up to 150 times before they are replaced, she said. Hotels typically pay between $25 and $50 per robe and tend to buy three sets of robes for each room to ensure that they have enough time to launder them between guests. At Kimpton, a team of six designers oversees the selection and vetting of robes. Once they've come up with a prototype they like, they test it by washing and drying it 30 times in a row. It's a tedious process, executives say, but one that can pay off when customers take notice. Guests often take to Instagram, Twitter and other social-media sites to gush over their robes. \"Aaaannnnd this is why I love @kimpton hotels!,\" a user posted on Facebook alongside a photo of herself flexing her muscles in the company's Rocky-inspired robe. \"I mean!? Cutest thing ever!\" \"Outrageously awesome,\" added a Twitter user. \"Slightly obsessed,\" said another. Courtney Doman, a 29-year-old from Austin who travels frequently for her sales job, says she has become something a hotel robe aficionado. \"It's not, like, the defining factor in whether I stay at a Kimpton, but it's definitely something I think about,\" she said. Her all-time favorite, she added, is a knit gray robe from the Solamar Hotel in downtown San Diego. \"It was so soft,\" she said. \"Honestly, I did consider taking that one home with me.\" Instead, she just tweeted about it: \"Thanks for a lovely stay -@HotelSolamar! I have a new favorite @Kimpton robe.\" Read more: The newest Silicon Valley perk? Paid time off to protest Trump.

            "body": "Administration officials and lawmakers of both parties on April 23 discussed funding for President Trump's project to build a border wall as the deadline for passing a government funding bill approaches. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) President Trump and his top aides applied new pressure Sunday on lawmakers to include money for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border in a must-pass government funding bill, raising the possibility of a federal government shutdown this week. In a pair of tweets, Trump attacked Democrats for opposing the wall and insisted that Mexico would pay for it \"at a later date,\" despite his repeated campaign promises not including that qualifier. And top administration officials appeared on Sunday morning news shows to press for wall funding, including White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, who said Trump might refuse to sign a spending bill that does not include any. [Experts say it's 50/50 the government will shut down next week] Democrats said they vigorously oppose any money for the border wall in a new spending bill, setting the stage for a last-minute showdown as the White House and lawmakers scramble to pass a stopgap bill to fund the government beyond the end of Friday, when funding will run out. Trump's position could also put him at odds with Republican congressional leaders, some of whom have voiced skepticism about including wall funding in the most immediate spending bill. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) made clear to rank-and-file GOP lawmakers on Saturday that his top priority was to pass a bill to keep government open. \"The Democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members,\" Trump tweeted Sunday morning. In a subsequent tweet, he wrote: \"Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall.\" On \"Fox News Sunday,\" host Chris Wallace asked Mulvaney, \"Will he [Trump] sign a government funding bill that does not include funding for the border wall?\" \"Yeah, and I think you saw his answer just in your little lead-in, which is: We don't know yet,\" Mulvaney said in the interview. He was referring to comments Trump recently made to the Associated Press. [The initial estimate is here: Trump's wall will cost more than a year of the space program] In an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus appeared to take a slightly less rigid approach to getting money for the border wall, repeatedly talking more generally about the need for \"border security.\" Still, he mentioned the wall in the context of the president's goals. \"I think that as long as the president's priorities are adequately reflected ... and there's enough as far as flexibility for the border wall and border security, I think we'll be okay with that,\" he said. Democrats took a hard stance against the wall. \"The wall is, in my view, immoral, expensive, unwise, and when the president says, 'Well, I promised a wall during my campaign,' I don't think he said he was going to pass billions of dollars of cost of the wall on to the taxpayer,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said on \"Meet the Press.\" Trump campaigned heavily on the promise of building a wall, which he said would curb illegal immigration and the flow of drugs into the United States. Mexico's president has said his country will not pay for the wall. \"I don't think anybody is trying to get to a shutdown,\" Mulvaney said. \"A shutdown is not a desired end. It's not a tool. It's not something we want to have. We want our priorities funded. And one of the biggest priorities during the campaign was border security - keeping Americans safe. And part of that was a border wall.\" Asked recently by the Associated Press whether he would sign a bill without border funding, Trump replied: \"I don't know yet. People want the border wall. My base definitely wants the border wall. My base really wants it.\" With less than a week to pass a new spending bill, negotiations between the White House, Republicans and Democrats are ramping up to avoid a government shutdown on April 29. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) Trump administration officials have steadily advocated for funding the wall in recent days. \"I think it goes without saying that the president has been pretty straightforward about his desire and the need for a border wall,\" Homeland Security Secretary John F. Kelly said in an interview with CNN's \"State of the Union\" that aired Sunday. \"So I would suspect, he'll do the right thing for sure, but I would suspect he will be insistent on the funding.\" Mulvaney has said that the administration is willing to negotiate with Democrats - funding insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in exchange for support for wall funding. [Ryan promises to keep government open - and makes no promises on health care] But Democratic leaders say they are not open to that. \"The White House gambit to hold hostage health care for millions of Americans, in order to force American taxpayers to foot the bill for a wall that the President said would be paid for by Mexico is a complete non-starter,\" Matt House, a spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), said in a statement Friday. House said Sunday that statement still stands. \"ObamaCare is in serious trouble. The Dems need big money to keep it going - otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought,\" Trump tweeted Sunday. It was unclear whether his tweet was meant to bolster Mulvaney's negotiating position. Republicans hold a 52-to-48 advantage over the Democratic caucus in the Senate. But Senate rules protecting the minority give Democrats some leverage. Senate Republicans must get 60 votes to pass legislation, meaning it is impossible to do so without some Democratic support. Further complicating matters for the White House, some Republicans in Congress say they don't view wall funding as a must-have item in a short term spending bill. \"We're just trying to finish out the current cycle, the current budget year,\" said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) on CBS's \"Face The Nation.\" \"And so I think that's a fight worth having and a conversation and a debate worth having for 2018. And if we can do some of that now, that would be great. But we cannot shut down the government right now.\" [Nearing 100 days, Trump's approval at record lows but his base is holding:] The spending showdown comes as Congress prepares to return from a two-week recess with a busy to-do list. Trump and some other Republicans have been pressing to revive work on health-care legislation, which stalled last month because Republicans could not agree on a strategy for repealing and replacing the ACA. On Sunday, Republicans from Congress and the administration sounded less than confident lawmakers would pass a revamped health-care bill this week. \"Health care may happen next week. It may not. We're hopeful it will,\" said Priebus. Meanwhile, the Trump administration plans to release a very general sketch of its tax reform plan this week, Mulvaney said. \"I think what are you going to see Wednesday is some specific governing principles, some guidance,\" he said, explaining that the White House will not release specific legislative text. \"Also some indications of what the rates are going to be.\" Asked whether the plan will be revenue-neutral, Mulvaney replied, \"I don't think we've decided that part yet.\" Joel Achenbach contributed to this report. 1 of 95 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 See what President Trump has been doing since taking office View Photos The beginning of his term has featured controversial executive orders and frequent conflicts with the media.

Most want the programs he and his jolly band of GOPers want to cut to the bone. Too bad no one in the administration looks at the failures Brownback has foisted on Kansas because that's the road Trump wants to take the nation down. \nHe's a stupid, stupid man whose only interest is himself and his family - wealth, more wealth for Trump &amp; Co.

Instead of a stupid concrete wall that's going to cost billions, why doesn't Trump come up with an immigration policy that will allow those workers here working in jobs that US citizens do not want such as farm labor, stay here.

But they are silent about a store's flexibility to add different markups to different items, as long as the markup doesn't go below zero.\n\nIf I were suddenly faced with a 20% cost increase on 1/4 of my inventory, I might very well reduce the markup on the import goods to absorb most of that 20% while increasing the markup on the 3/4 of my inventory to take up the slack.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, though, it is the American consumer who loses the most.

            "body": "Ian Harkes made his sixth consecutive start Saturday at Gillette Stadium. (Winslow Townson/USA Today Sports) FOXBOROUGH, Mass. - In some ways, Ian Harkes has not separated himself from his famous father. He, too, starred at an elite ACC program. He, too, is a midfielder. Before signing a homegrown contract this winter with D.C. United, the team John Harkes captained at MLS's birth 21 years ago, Ian explored opportunity at Derby County, his dad's second English employer. But as rookie reticence gives way to swelling self-confidence this spring, the younger Harkes is carving a clear identity. The last name's the same; the second-generation player is an original. Saturday marked his sixth consecutive start since he watched the opener from the bench. With six ailing regulars, including playmaker Luciano Acosta, watching from home or the sideline, Harkes was at the heart of United's attack during a 2-2 draw with the New England Revolution (which happened to be his father's second MLS team). His body language exuded growing conviction, as if, after almost two months deferring to his experienced colleagues, he was ready to seize initiative despite the absence of professional experience. Twice in the first half, he almost scored: a swerving bid from 20 yards that kissed the left post and a header that banged off the crossbar. \"He continues to grow and he continues to prove he belongs,\" said Coach Ben Olsen, who, as a teammate of John Harkes in 1998, has known Ian since he was a child. \"Got a little closer to scoring. Maybe next week, one will hit the net.\" [From January: Like father, like son: Ian Harkes signs with D.C. United] The 2016 Hermann Trophy winner for College Cup finalist Wake Forest figured to play a greater part than most D.C. prospects. Olsen had paired him with Acosta in an advanced central midfield position, a role that required Harkes, 22, to forge chemistry with the Argentine while also putting in defensive work. On Saturday, with a sore ankle keeping Acosta off Gillette Stadium's artificial turf until the 77th minute, Harkes conducted the attack while Marcelo Sarvas and Jared Jeffrey provided support toiling in the trenches. \"I'm a little more comfortable,\" Harkes, a Fairfax resident and Gonzaga High graduate, said ahead of the northern trip. \"Hopefully comfort doesn't become complacency, because I have so much to learn and so much to add to my game. Each week I'm going to try to keep growing.\" Also, as he adapts from the simplicity of college soccer to the unforgiving demands of pro soccer, Harkes is beginning to show greater enterprise. At first, he seemed apprehensive among hardened teammates, most notably Acosta, a transplant from Argentina's famous Boca Juniors. \"You want to learn from them and see what they do,\" he said. \"It's hard to compose yourself completely, but in midfield, you have to be a driving force, so I am going to have to keep stepping up. Getting shots off and being a little more dangerous in the final third is something I need to add. I'll have to keep looking for it.\" Although Ian is coming into his own, the son is not altogether different from the father. \"He's done a pretty good job hiding his personality playing second fiddle and understanding he's a rookie,\" Olsen said. \"But he's got a little of his dad in him - the competitiveness and pride. I see that slowly coming in, and that's a very good thing.\" A reunion of sorts played out the previous weekend at Red Bull Arena, which sits three miles from the Harkes family homestead in Kearny, N.J. There, Ian's grandparents settled after emigrating from Scotland, and John learned the game in the ethnic enclave with, among others, future World Cup teammates Tony Meola and Tab Ramos. More than 100 family and friends watched Ian log 90 minutes in a 2-0 defeat to the New York Red Bulls. \"All of the Jersey guys,\" Ian said, laughing. \"My aunt got her hands on a lot of tickets.\" While the team bused home, Harkes stayed behind for Easter. He then headed back to Washington to continue his soccer education - and to build stamina. College seasons last three months, MLS's eight. Olsen believes Harkes has the proper mental strength and physical traits, not unlike former D.C. defensive midfielder Perry Kitchen, who, the coach joked, \"hit a rookie wall for about two hours. \"Ian has that type of personality. I think he will stay in it and understand how much focus it takes to be a week-in and week-out pro.\"",

(Luke MacGregor/Reuters) On Saturday, thousands showed up to a polling place in Montreal, creating a line that was more than a mile long. They were there to cast their ballots, but not for a Canadian election, as the turnout might have suggested. Rather, it was for a presidential race an ocean away - in France. The scene was replicated in cities across the world this weekend, despite some being thousands of miles away from France. French expats in the United States and Canada began voting Saturday, a day before the polls opened in France. Expats in other parts joined in the vote on Sunday, some waiting in line for hours, spurred by the significance of the increasingly tense election in their home country. In a field of 11 candidates, a handful have emerged as front-runners - including far-left politician Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, 65, and the far-right Marine Le Pen, 48 - and only the two candidates who receive the most votes Sunday, assuming no one wins an outright majority, will advance to the final round on May 7. The result of the presidential election is likely to have dramatic consequences for France, the European Union and international security. Many expats said the election was too critical to sit out. The voting lines are huge!

The extreme left is not any better.\" [What you need to know about the French presidential election] There had been concerns that many French citizens would abstain from voting, but that did not appear to be the case as of Sunday afternoon. So far, voter turnout is on track with 2012 levels. On Sunday morning, hundreds of French expats showed up outside the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Charles de Gaulle in London, creating a line that hugged the building and wound around the block almost as far as the eye could see. The French Embassy in Britain tweeted that the average wait time to vote was one to 1\u00bd hours. \"Let's not spread #fakenews and discourage people from voting! #JeVoteaLondres,\" the embassy tweeted. One French voter in London seemed to be motivated to push back against the populist surges that have overtaken Britain and the United States in the past year. \"We've already had Brexit and Trump,\" Marc Jeannin told the Guardian. \"We don't need a third shock.\" I have NEVER seen queues this long.

Slate's Henry Grabar wrote of French expats wrestling with conflicting emotions as they waited to cast their ballots in Brooklyn the same day. \"Maybe the strategy was to attempt to boost the conservative Fran\u00e7ois Fillon into the runoff, instead of padding the lead of the front-running centrist Emmanuel Macron. Or did that leave Macron vulnerable to the surging M\u00e9lenchon?\" Grabar wrote. \"One woman, who had arrived undecided, said it was the first time she had cried in the voting booth. She wouldn't say whom she chose.\" On social media throughout the weekend, French expats from Japan to Germany shared selfies and pictures of long lines and polling places with the hashtag #JaiVote, or \"I voted.\" French expats vote in Tokyo ...

If the coworker believes your speech has created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment and seeks redress under Title VII, does the First Amendment protect your speech?

I agree that if a person stood up in front of an audience and expressed words that were \"arousing, deserving of, or filled with hatred\" (i.e., hateful) about women that their speech would be protected by the First Amendment should any state actor attempt to punish them. However, if that same person was at work and was with a large group of coworkers and expressed the same ideas, that hate speech is not going to be protected by the First Amendment under a Title VII claim.\n\nTo add another wrinkle, if a person is with a group and expresses hateful speech about blacks and then kills a black person and the state decides to seek a sentencing enhancement under a Hate Crime law, the state can introduce as evidence the hateful speech made by the killer. That speech can then be used to infer the motive necessary for the sentence enhancement, thus punishing the killer more more severely. The First Amendment does not protect the killer's speech from being introduced as evidence.\n\nIn short, there are \"hate speech\" exceptions to the First Amendment, it just depends on the context. Volokh, and now Kerr, have presented the issue as an \"either/or\" situation, for whatever reason. But it's not. It's more of a qualified situation in which context and situation matter.

            "body": "Living alone can be tough for seniors. Some don't have family nearby to check on them, and they worry that if they fall or suffer a medical emergency and can't get to the phone to seek help, no one will know. That's why hundreds of police agencies in small towns, suburbs and rural areas are checking in on seniors who live alone by placing an automated call to them every day. Police officials say the calling systems, which are fairly inexpensive and easy to use, provide an important service to a senior population that is expected to grow to 65 million nationwide by 2025. Already, nearly half of women age 75 and older live alone. Advocates for older people say telephone check-in programs can help seniors remain independent in their homes and give them - and their family members - peace of mind. \"It helps ensure for the elderly person or their family that a phone call is being made every morning, that everything is okay. We've gotten incredible feedback on this program,\" said Cmdr. Jack Vaccaro of the Lighthouse Point Police Department in Florida, which has nine seniors in its automated daily-call program. [Your elderly parent is home from the hospital. What happens next?] Such automated systems began nearly three decades ago. They now are used by police departments from California to Massachusetts. Some police agencies take a more personal approach, using volunteers or dispatchers to place the calls. Police departments are becoming more sensitive to the needs of older adults, said Sandy Markwood, chief executive of the National Association of Area Agencies on Aging. For instance, she said, her organization is training officers in how to handle seniors with dementia. Telephone check-in programs are one way of doing that. \"I think we're seeing a trend with these types of programs, particularly in rural and smaller communities,\" she said. \"It's a wise use of government dollars for first responders.\" Minimal costs Seniors who sign up for telephone reassurance programs decide when they want to be called. They also are typically required to give police the name and phone number of an emergency contact. Participants get a computer-generated phone call every day - sometimes recorded by the police chief or sheriff - that asks them to press a certain number if they are okay. If they don't answer the phone, they'll get another computer-generated call, and sometimes additional ones. If they still don't answer, police usually will try to get in touch with their emergency contact before dispatching an officer to the home to check on them. Seniors who know they're going to be out when the phone rings at the specified time are supposed to notify police in advance. But sometimes they forget, and dispatchers end up sending out a unit on a false call. While that does happen, police officials say it's not a frequent occurrence, so the personnel costs are minimal. Some agencies, such as the police department in Winter Park, Fla., also require participants to put a house key in a secured box - similar to boxes used by real estate agents - somewhere outside the house. Emergency responders know the code and can open the box and enter the house if necessary. The price tag for telephone reassurance systems varies. RUOK, the nation's largest source, is used by hundreds of police agencies, according to Bruce Johnson, owner of the Minnesota company that developed and sells the software. It costs about $1,000 to buy and set up, and it has no maintenance fees. Database Systems, a Phoenix-based data management company that has sold its system to dozens of police departments, charges nearly $11,000 for purchase, installation and the first year of maintenance, company vice president Jerry Pizet said. After that, most agencies do their own maintenance. Winter Park Police Officer Randall Morrissey said his agency uses RUOK software that runs on an old laptop and was paid for with forfeiture funds. Running the program doesn't cost the department anything, he said, other than the expense of sending out an officer on a false call, which isn't often. \"A lot of the seniors who sign up are concerned that they could pass and not be discovered for days,\" Morrissey said. \"With this program, it's comforting for them to know they could be found.\" That was the reason the Belton Police Department in Texas launched its telephone check-in program in 2013, according to Detective Sgt. Kim Hamilton. The impetus: an incident in which officers found an elderly woman who been had been dead on the floor of her home for at least two months. \"That alone spoke volumes to us,\" Hamilton said. \"We knew there was a need to check on our senior residents.\" 'Economy of scale' The check-in programs are less common in big cities, where large numbers of people might sign up, potentially straining budgets because more officers would be needed to check on seniors who don't answer their phones. But in small cities and towns, suburbs and rural areas, the programs can be more manageable. \"It's economy of scale,\" said Capt. Larry Murphy, of the Biloxi, Miss., Police Department. \"If you're in a really large city, you'd have to add more and more resources.\" In Biloxi, a city of about 44,000, only 14 seniors are registered. While many police departments want to sign up as many seniors as possible, Murphy said his tries to limit its program to \"people who really need it rather than those who just want it.\" Murphy said the system has experienced some outages in the past few years because of lightning damage to the dispatch center. That means dispatchers sometimes have to call each senior, which is \"resource-intensive but manageable\" with a limited number of participants. Some police agencies that once used automated check-in systems, such as those in Brentwood, Mo., and Amherst, Mass., have stopped using them. Agencies that choose to give up the systems usually do so because participants move away or die and not enough seniors sign up to replace them. Police officials agree that for telephone reassurance programs to succeed in the long term, they need to be continuously marketed. Some departments do that by publicizing them on websites, at senior centers and in apartment complexes and churches. The human touch Some police agencies go beyond automated check-ins and use staff or volunteers to dial up seniors and talk to them one-on-one. Every weekday morning, a staffer at the Orangeburg County Sheriff's Office in South Carolina makes 50 to 60 calls to see whether seniors in the reassurance program are okay. In Belton, 130 seniors get an automated call every weekday except Wednesday, when they get a live call from one of dozens of volunteers, according to Hamilton. \"Sometimes that's the only person the senior talks to that week,\" she said. A part-time coordinator oversees the volunteers and is paid through a grant from the Area Agency on Aging of Central Texas. This year's grant was for $21,000. \"Considering what the police have to deal with every day, this is totally the opposite end of the spectrum,\" said Pam Patterson, an area agency contract manager. \"It gives them an opportunity to really help seniors.\" And in Belton, as in some other parts of the country, police say the program has saved lives. Belton police have had four \"saves\" so far, Hamilton said, including a man who fell to the floor in his house and stayed there from Friday, after his last check-in, until Monday, when his next call came. 'The personal touch' In San Diego County, Calif., one of the bigger areas to run a call reassurance service, the sheriff's department's program goes far beyond automated calls. As part of its You Are Not Alone effort, 452 senior volunteer patrol members call 334 older adults at least five times a week and visit them at least weekly. \"We think the personal touch is a little bit better, in the event something else is going on,\" said Sgt. Monica Sanchez. \"Our senior volunteers are trained to see if there is food in the fridge or if there are signs of neglect. An automated program would not work for us. We like to observe and report.\" Sanchez said the volunteers have helped save people's lives, such as when they visited the home of an 86-year-old woman last year, got no response and noticed her mail had been piling up. They contacted deputies, who climbed through a window and found the woman on the floor, severely dehydrated. \"They were just in time to save her life,\" Sanchez said. [House calls are coming back.

(Geoff Burke/USA Today Sports) TORONTO - The Maple Leafs' top line, with center Auston Matthews, was on the ice less than a minute into overtime of Game 5, and Capitals Coach Barry Trotz deployed his second line with one alteration. Rather than have center Evgeny Kuznetsov take the faceoff on his weak side, he put Jay Beagle, a right-handed centerman, in the dot with Kuznetsov as a wing. \"In an overtime, a faceoff in a zone, it's something that as a centerman, you kind of live for,\" Beagle said. [Game 6 preview: Washington has the momentum. Now it must finish.] Beagle won the faceoff against Matthews, and upon seeing defenseman Matt Niskanen carrying the puck up the ice, Beagle started skating toward the bench to change for right wing Justin Williams. \"It's a big draw because I don't want to get scored on,\" Beagle said. But Beagle winning that faceoff not only helped the Capitals get the puck out of their own end, it set up the game-winning goal. Williams entered the offensive zone late, potentially causing some confusion as he skated into the slot just in time to receive a pass from Kuznetsov and then score. That play lifted Washington to a 2-1 overtime win and a three-games-to-two series lead over the Maple Leafs in this first round. The Capitals have Toronto on the brink of elimination going into Sunday night's Game 6, and if the other games in this series are any indication, faceoff could play a significant role. The Maple Leafs owned the Capitals on draws in the first two games of the series, and in Game 2, Washington won less than 40 percent of the faceoffs in the game. Since then, the Capitals have steadily improved and have won the majority of them. It's helped Washington feel like it is in more control of the game. [Steinberg: 'That's why he's Justin': Playoff superhero can't stop being clutch] \"Starting with the puck or not starting with the puck, chasing or dictating,\" Beagle said. \"It's pretty simple: You've got to win draws to be able to feel like you're going to be able to come at them.\" Beagle said that as the series has gone on, he and Washington's other centers have been able to catch on to the Maple Leafs' tendencies in the faceoff circle. Friday's game was the Capitals' most convincing in the dot, with them winning 55 percent of the draws. Toronto Coach Mike Babcock specifically mentioned neutral-zone draws as being a difference in the last game. \"You think about it that it's no a big deal that you just lost a neutral-zone faceoff, but then you end up spending a ton of time in your own zone,\" Babcock said. \"Obviously some draws are bigger than others,\" Maple Leafs center Brian Boyle said. \"But as a whole, you want the puck. Both teams want the puck. It's easier to kind of dictate play and make sure that we're doing the things we want to do when we have the puck. ... If you start with it, it's a lot easier to feel good about your shift after, rather than chasing it around for 10 or 15 seconds.\" Beagle is the Capitals' fourth-line center, but throughout the season, Trotz has had him take the faceoff for other lines since he's the only right-handed center. He also amazingly won 56.8 percent of the draws he took in the defensive zone, when he would've had to put his stick down first, a disadvantage. No other regular Washington center was above 46 percent during the regular season. Beagle has noticed the Maple Leafs employing a similar strategy by having Tyler Bozak occasionally take faceoffs with other lines on the right side. \"Both teams are trying to get the puck, and we have some veteran guys who are pretty good at it and they do, too,\" Trotz said. \"I think in the first couple of games, they did a much better job, but our guys are good pros and they adjust to what they're doing. I think we've made our adjustments and therefore we got it back on even keel for the rest anyways.\"",

            "body": "KASSERINE, Tunisia One evening last fall, the Islamic State fighters came down from the mountains. Sayed Ghozlani was visiting his family during a break from the army, and the fighters wanted to find him. They stormed his house during dinner and corralled the men. They beat them up, tied their hands behind their backs and forced them all to kneel. Then one fighter pressed a gun against Ghozlani\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head and demanded his name. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAbdul Malik,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he replied. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the truth,\u00e2\u0080\u009d another militant said in a voice that was familiar, according to two witnesses. His face bloodied, Ghozlani looked up to see a figure carrying an AK-47 rifle and smiling triumphantly. It was his cousin, Muntasir. In the mountains of western Tunisia, radical Islamists are spreading their ideology, cowing villagers with brute violence and dividing families. American-trained Tunisian soldiers are battling them, but the militants are formidable opponents. The struggle lays bare the Islamic State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s aspirations as it loses territory in Iraq and Syria, security officials and analysts say. The militants are searching for new safe havens and areas to control, as well as sow chaos. They are also fortifying existing footholds to expand their reach and fallback options. In Egypt, Islamic State militants are staging devastating attacks on minority Christians. In Algeria and the Sahel region, new Islamic State affiliates have emerged. And after losing its Libyan stronghold of Sirte in December, the Islamic State is trying to regroup in southern Libya, and potentially in Tunisia and other neighboring countries, U.S. military and intelligence officials say. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe instability in Libya and North Africa may be the most significant near-term threat to U.S. and allies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 interests on the continent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gen. Thomas D. Waldhauser, head of the Pentagon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Africa Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last month. The return of possibly thousands of fighters threatens to further destabilize this moderate Muslim North African nation, the only one to emerge as a functioning democracy after the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. Less than 15 miles from the Algerian border, the mountains have become a crossroads for militants from the region. Caves and bushes provide plenty of cover for training camps and redoubts in an area that is partly ungoverned. In villages and towns, the forces abetting radicalization are in full gear: Ignored by successive governments, the region is beset with high unemployment, poverty and weak social services. Resentment toward the government runs deep. On that November evening, these colluding forces led one cousin to betray another. \u00e2\u0080\u009cEver since my brother joined the army, our cousin wanted to kill him,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Fadha Ghozlani, 35, who was in the house during the attack, along with their younger brother, Mohammed. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe brought the terrorists to our home.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Spreading radicalism By U.N. estimates, at least 5,500 Tunisians have fought for the Islamic State and al-Qaeda in Syria, Iraq and Libya \u00e2\u0080\u0094 more than from any other country. Many are from the Kasserine region. But even as Tunisia became a militant pipeline to the wars in those countries, its secular history and drift toward the West made it a target. In 2015, Tunisian gunmen believed to have trained in Libya attacked the resort town of Sousse and the Bardo Museum in the capital, Tunis, killing scores, mostly foreign tourists. Last year, Islamic State fighters based in Libya brazenly battled security forces in the southern border town of Ben Guerdane, widely seen as an effort to establish a new foothold in Tunisia. That foothold seems to be taking shape in these mountains, where the Islamic State is also in a contest with al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, for recruits and territory. Many AQIM fighters have defected to form the Islamic State\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tunisian branch, Jund-al-Khilafah, which in Arabic means the Soldiers of the Caliphate, security officials and analysts say. There are no more than a couple hundred militants in the mountains, security officials say, including some from Algeria, Mauritania and West African countries. But most of the fighters are Tunisians from the area, disaffected men such as Muntasir. By the time he joined the Islamic State last summer, it had become harder to travel to the wars abroad. The nation is under emergency law. Men under 35 need written permission from their parents to leave the country. A 125-mile earthen wall was built along the border with Libya to prevent jihadists from leaving and entering. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe security situation is improving,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Yasser Mesbah, an Interior Ministry spokesman. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say the threat is over.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Consider this: 3,576 Tunisians were tried last year on terrorism-related charges, including recruitment and training, according to Interior Ministry data. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe bigger issue, not just for Tunisia, but for all of us, is this: What about the guys who have not left the state to fight?\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Patrice Bergamini, the European Union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambassador to Tunisia. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are like ticking bombs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Quiet conversion Sayed and Muntasir grew up near each other in Thmad, a bucolic village in the mountains. Born the same year, they played together and often slept in the same room. They were both tall, lean and handsome. Their families, like others in their once close-knit community, farmed and grazed sheep. They celebrated holidays and festivals together. By the time the cousins turned 20, the Arab Spring uprisings were transforming Tunisia. In Kasserine, violent protests in January 2011 played a central role in the ousting of dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali. Like other southern areas, it had been ignored by the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s northern elite for decades. Neither cousin took part in the revolution. Muntasir was growing crops and tending to his family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sheep on the mountains. And by then, Sayed had joined the army to help support his parents and siblings. But Sayed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s job drove the two cousins apart. Muntasir soon viewed him as a member of Ben Ali\u00e2\u0080\u0099s oppressive regime. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen Muntasir learned that Sayed had enlisted in the army, he used to call him \u00e2\u0080\u0098tyrant,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0089\u00e2\u0080\u009d recalled Mohammed Ghozlani, 25, Sayed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s younger brother. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe used to throw this word in our faces whenever he saw us in a local cafe or other places. But at that time, he didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t try to harm us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d After the revolt, a new openness flourished. But that also paved the way for religious extremists to attract youths frustrated with the lack of opportunities. In mosques and Islamic education camps, imams implored young people to give up their Western ways and urged them to defend Islam. Mohamed Zorgui, a rapper and community youth leader, recalled that in 2013 \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe black Islamic State flags were being displayed openly in the city center.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The flags are gone, but the sense of despair lingers. The promises of economic growth that emerged after the revolution remain unfulfilled, and cafes are filled during the day with idle young men of working age. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe youth have no idea what the future will bring,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mahmoud Kahri, a lawmaker representing Kasserine. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAnd the government has found no efficient way to address their problems.\u00e2\u0080\u009d That has garnered more sympathy for the militants. In January, protests broke out in the town over the lack of jobs. Some youths burned tires. Others branded government officials \u00e2\u0080\u009cnonbelievers\u00e2\u0080\u009d and chanted \u00e2\u0080\u009cISIS is coming,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Zorgui recalled. In Al Karma and Al Zuhour, two hardscrabble enclaves in the town of Kasserine, dozens of families have sons who left to fight abroad or were recruited by the militants in the mountains. Scrawled on the wall of a school in Al Zuhour are the words: \u00e2\u0080\u009cISIS is lasting and expanding.\u00e2\u0080\u009d By all accounts, Muntasir was not a devout Muslim. He rarely attended mosque or prayed five times a day. But last spring, his relatives noticed that he started praying and engaging in discussions about Islam. \u00e2\u0080\u009cMuntasir used to drink alcohol, and then, one day, he suddenly started to speak about religion,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mohammed Ghozlani recalled. Yet, Muntasir kept his sympathies to the Islamic State a secret, and many family members didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t realize he had joined the militancy until he had vanished into the mountains during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan last summer. Mafoud Bin Daraie, a 40-year-old imam and community leader, said the militants have largely drawn recruits from rural young men who \u00e2\u0080\u009chave wrong impressions of Islam or are very poor.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He has tried to stop several Kasserine youth from heading overseas to fight or into the mountains. But now the imam is a target. \u00e2\u0080\u0098Fuel to the battle\u00e2\u0080\u0099 A few months ago, a Tunisian militant with a handgun entered Daraie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mosque during Friday prayers. But security forces were tipped off, and before he could pull the trigger, they grabbed him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey tried to kill me because I spoke out against them,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Daraie said. A few blocks from his mosque, a house is pocked with softball-sized holes from heavy gunfire. In August, security forces fought a nine-hour battle with militants holed up there. Two of the gunmen, along with a passer-by, were killed. One day last summer, the militants accused Najib Guasmi, 37, a shepherd, of being an informant for the security forces. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey killed him with a bullet to his head,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said his brother, Hadi. The militants have also planted land mines, killing several civilians in recent months. At least a dozen Tunisian fighters returning from Syria and Iraq have joined the militants, said Ridha Raddaoui, co-author of a recent report on terrorism by the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights. As more fighters return, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthey will be fuel to the battle in the mountains against the Tunisian state,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he added. At checkpoints in the towns, Tunisian security forces search vehicles for weapons and bombs. Soldiers patrol in Humvees and armored personnel carriers. Suspected militants have been arrested and sent to jail. But a recent visit to the mountains, under armed escort, revealed the security challenges on this vast terrain dotted with cactus and pine trees along dry riverbeds. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are fighters everywhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said a national guard commander, pointing at the mountains, a Belgian-made rifle slung over his shoulder. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to journalists. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the necessary means and equipment to fight them.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The security forces, he said, were stretched thin and lacked equipment to track down the militants. \u00e2\u0080\u009cGod is the only one protecting us now,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. A tragic return On that November evening, Muntasir was determined to confront his cousin. By then, he was routinely coming down from the mountains to pick up food and supplies. Nearly half the village was helping the militants. The other half lived in fear. Sayed, too, was coming home \u00e2\u0080\u0094 despite the omens. On one visit, a cousin told him that if he had a gun he would kill him on the spot. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI told my brother, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come to the house. Muntasir is watching you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u009d Fadha Ghozlani recalled. But Sayed was close to his mother, and she needed money. As Sayed glared at Muntasir in their house, his mother began to cry. She begged Muntasir not to harm her son. But the militants hauled Sayed into a guest room. Muntasir joined them. Moments later, two bullets pierced the back of Sayed\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head.",

About the only things linking them are that name, and actions to attack government and civilians.  And the name has even less meaning than a fast-food franchise name in the US;  all you have to do to get the Islamic State franchise in your area is to swear fealty (bay'ah) to al-Baghdadi.

Aircraft can increase the chances of locating them on the way out, and inflicting casualties on the retreating enemy before they disperse and disappear.

(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) PARIS - The French presidential campaign has featured divisive rhetoric and a remarkable number of memorable quotes. Of the 11 candidates, only two will make it to the second round of the election. Exit polls on Sunday evening showed centrist Emmanuel Macron with a lead of two percentage points over far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who came in second. Here are the two leading candidates in their own words. MARINE LE PEN On Islamism: \"Islamism is a monstrous totalitarian ideology that has declared war on our nation, on reason, on civilization ... Hate preachers must be expelled, the Islamist mosques closed.\" Speech in Paris, April 21, 2017 On France's place in the world: \"What is at stake in this election is the continuity of France as a free nation, our existence as a people ... The French have been dispossessed of their patriotism. They are suffering in silence from not being allowed to love their country ... The divide is no longer between the left and the right, but between the patriots and the globalists.\" Speech in Lyon, Feb. 5, 2017 On globalization: \"Financial globalization and Islamist globalization are helping each other out,\" she said. \"Those two ideologies aim to bring France to its knees.\" Speech in Lyon, Feb. 5, 2017 On economic policy: \"Putin's Russia is our role model for a patriotic economic policy.\" March 2017 in Moscow On the roundup and detention of about 13,000 Jews by French police in an indoor Parisian stadium called Vel d'Hiv on July 16-17, 1942. Many of them were later deported to Auschwitz: \"I think France is not responsible for the Vel d'Hiv ... I think in a general way, more generally actually, those responsible were those in power then; this is not France.\" April 2017, Interview on RTL Radio EMMANUEL MACRON On terrorism: \"The zero-risk option doesn't exist. Whoever pretends that with him or her - a few days ago I heard Marine Le Pen say that with her there wouldn't have been an attack - is both irresponsible and a liar. The zero-risk option doesn't exist. We're living with risk. The question is to see how to eradicate this risk.\" In an April 21, 2017, interview with RTL On Europe: \"We can achieve peace with a strong army, a strong diplomacy, deterrent weapons and a strong Europe.\" Speech in Nantes, April 20, 2017 On France's colonial past: \"Colonization is a part of French history. It is a crime, a crime against mankind ... This is a past that we must look in the eye, by apologizing to those we harmed.\" During a visit to Algeria, Feb. 15, 2017 On his vision: \"Preventing the civilized world from falling apart and enabling the world of tomorrow to happen, such is our responsibility and our mission.\" At a rally in Paris, April 17, 2017 On his place in the political spectrum: \"Just like de Gaulle, I choose the best of the right, the left and the center.\" At a rally in Paris, April 17, 2017 On Russia: \"We'll have to talk to Russia ... A great country, with whom we have a shared history. But shouldn't we be outraged when human rights are violated? Should we accept the creation of camps for homosexuals in Chechnya?\" At a rally in Paris, April 17, 2017 Virgile Benichoux contributed to this report.

            "body": "Attorney General Jeff Sessions. (Susan Walsh/AP) The Trump administration is struggling to explain precisely what it intends to do about people who are in the country illegally. President Trump told the Associated Press on Friday that the \"dreamers\" - people brought into the country illegally as children and now protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program put in place under President Barack Obama - should \"rest easy\" and not worry about deportation. But Attorney General Jeff Sessions, echoing comments he made last week, said Sunday that anyone in the country illegally could be deported - and stressed that the Trump administration, for now, is targeting only those engaged in criminal activity. Interviewed on ABC's \"This Week,\" Sessions said the Department of Homeland Security has jurisdiction in such matters and has put a priority on the criminal element. \"There's no doubt the president has sympathy for young people who were brought here at early ages,\" he said. When the show's host, George Stephanopoulos, then asked whether that means the \"dreamers\" can rest easy, Sessions answered, \"Well, we'll see. I believe that everyone that enters the country unlawfully is subject to being deported; however, we've got - we don't have the ability to round up everybody, and there's no plans to do that.\" That stance tracks what Sessions said during another recent television interview when asked about a 23-year-old man who had \"dreamer\" status and has been deported to Mexico, according to immigration advocates and lawyers. Sessions said he didn't know why the man had been deported but added, \"We can't promise people who are here unlawfully that they're not going to be deported.\" Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly appeared Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union\" and said he's not looking to deport \"dreamers\" or anyone else who is not actively engaged in criminal enterprises. But he again made clear that broader deportations would be possible under the letter of the law. \"The point that I think the attorney general is making is they are here unlawfully and are subject to deportation.  That's what the law says.  Now what we actually do is another story.  And as I say, we are not targeting - my organization has not targeted these so-called dreamers, DACA.  And we have many, many more important criminals to go after and get rid of, and not the DACAs,\" Kelly said. He added, addressing the immigrant community: \"If you are simply here illegally, we don't really have the time go after you. We're looking for bad men and women.\" Xavier Becerra, California's attorney general, said on \"This Week\" that the messages from Washington have been confusing. \"It's not clear what we can trust, what statement we can believe in,\" Becerra said. \"And that causes a great deal of, not just anxiety, but confusion, not just for those immigrant communities but for our law enforcement personnel.\"",

He has been the US Senate's thought leader on the concept of race-based immigration control for many years.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, during the year 2015, 216,000 Canadians and European passport holders overstayed their visas in the US. If we extrapolate that figure by ten years, for argument's sake, we arrive at a figure of 2 million people.\n\nIt is known that visa overstays amount to 40% of the total number of undocumented in the US.\n\nIf the Trump administration were to actually carry-out the mass deportations that the President spoke-of in his campaign in a fair and balanced matter, he would have to target the millions of white and Asian visa overstays among the undocumented.\n\nIt is preposterous to think that he is going to do that.\n\nDoes any American, of any race or political persuasion, actually believe that Donald Trump, Jefferson Sessions and John Kelly are going to send armies of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers into the Irish ghettos and working class communities of Boston and New York, to rip the estimated 50,000 Irish undocumented away from the loving arms of their American families? \n\nIt is simply inconceivable that such raids, targeting white undocumented residents, could happen. Why? Because Donald Trump sold border security and mass deportation as a racially-focused targeting of Mexicans and other people of color.\n\nRaiding South Boston to round-up its undocumented Irish is not what Trump supporters signed-up for.\n\nPerpetrating ethnic cleansing that aligns with Steve Bannon's white supremacist views is immoral.

They revealed wrongdoing by Session's office throughout the investigation, including the witholding of exculpatory evidence. The stste dropped dozens of the charges. Citing prosecutorial misconduct, the judge dismissed the rest and wrote a brutal opinion slamming Sessions' office.

            "body": "Bill Nye the Science Guy. (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post) The moment he emerged onstage in a black jacket and red bow tie, the crowd noise hit near-deafening decibels. A sea of iPhones appeared, everyone stretching and jostling for the best possible photo angle. They cupped their hands to their mouths, screaming his name. \"Greetings, fellow citizens,\" Bill Nye said to the thousands huddled beneath umbrellas and hand-lettered signs. \"We are marching today to remind people everywhere, our lawmakers especially, of the significance of science for our health and prosperity.\" Near the foot of the stage, a young woman with a bright-green pixie cut shouted: \"I love you!\" It was a significant moment - for science, for William Sanford Nye and for the masses who have followed him for decades, from fuzzy TV screens in their middle school classrooms to the grounds of the Washington Monument at Saturday's March for Science. He is beloved by millennials who came of age watching the '90s-era PBS series \"Bill Nye the Science Guy,\" a role that made him an icon: half mad professor, half Mr. Rogers, perpetually clad in a pale-blue lab coat and bow tie as he unveiled the science of eroding mountains or orbiting comets with theatrical flourish. More than 20 years later, the 61-year-old still wears the bow ties, and he still punctuates his speech with impassioned catchphrases. (\"It's not magic, it's science!\" is his new favorite.) But now his disheveled locks and vaguely Vulcan eyebrows are streaked with gray, and his persona has assumed a new edge. He has become more than the zany educator-entertainer who charmed kids with cartoonish sound effects. He is an activist for science, leading those now-grownups into political battle. Of all the roles he has played, this is the one he was preparing for all along. (The Washington Post) \"I did imagine it could come to this,\" Nye said Friday, during a visit to The Washington Post the day before the march. By \"this,\" he meant the legions of scientists, doctors, engineers and concerned members of the public taking to the streets of Washington and more than 600 cities worldwide. Their demonstration was a response to the rise of anti-scientific notions - the anti-vaccination movement and climate-change denial in particular - and a retort to the Trump administration, which has proposed deep budget cuts for the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Institutes of Health. [Why people are marching for science: 'There is no Planet B'] In the weeks before the march, many called this kind of mass protest from the scientific community unprecedented. But Nye was not surprised. The current \"anti-science thing,\" he said, had been on the rise for decades. \"People were denying pollution in 1970, saying it's a-okay.\" He took note of the early warning signs as a young man in Seattle, where he got his start in broadcasting with a local sketch-comedy show. He also was volunteering on weekends at the Pacific Science Center and with the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program. \"I realized that kids are the future,\" he said. \"The reason I made the 'Science Guy' show was quite deliberate. If we can get young people excited about science, then we have a shot. I knew I was fighting the fight.\" [Bill Nye on the March for Science: 'There's been a movement to set science aside.'] The fight is political, but not partisan, he emphasizes. Still, he has drawn his share of partisan critics. Some, like Sarah Palin, have questioned whether Nye is actually qualified to speak on behalf of science: \"Bill Nye is as much a scientist as I am,\" she once declared. Nye chuckles in response: \"Well, Ms. Palin, you're wrong.\" To be fair: He did make his name as an entertainer. \"I'm not a research scientist,\" he acknowledged, like his good friend and fellow science celebrity Neil deGrasse Tyson, who climbed the academic ranks as an astrophysicist. Nye earned his bachelor's in mechanical engineering at Cornell then went to work for Boeing. His fancier science credentials - designing an interplanetary sundial used by NASA and becoming chief executive of the Planetary Society, a space-advocacy group co-founded by Carl Sagan - came after his TV fame. Nye takes a selfie with a fan backstage before addressing the rally. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) Nye, the self-styled \"Science Guy,\" speaks at the March for Science. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) Still, his education was grounded in the scientific method. And, he argues, it doesn't take a paleontologist to defend evolution or a meteorologist to comprehend the perils of climate change. \"When you become scientifically literate, I claim, you become an environmentalist,\" he said. \"Somewhere along the way, there has developed this idea that if you believe something hard enough, it's as true as things discovered through the process of science. And I will say that's objectively wrong.\" And so, at a moment when science is at the forefront of public discussion, Nye has found himself in the spotlight once again - though in truth, he has never quite left it. Since \"Science Guy\" ended its five-year run in 1998, Nye has hosted other science-education programs, sold out lecture halls and written best-selling books. He also has racked up pop-culture cred, with appearances on \"Dancing with the Stars,\" \"The Big Bang Theory\" and \"Inside Amy Schumer.\" He debuted a new 13-episode Netflix series Friday, \"Bill Nye Saves the World,\" with a more urgent tone, and aimed at a broader audience, than his public TV days. His fans include former president Barack Obama, who invited Nye to visit the Everglades with him on Earth Day 2015, and more than 4 million Twitter followers. But none are so devout as the 20- and 30-somethings who mob him everywhere he goes. (He happily obliges the selfie-seekers, always reminding them: \"Look at the lens, not at yourself!\") Nye isn't married, and he never had children of his own - a neurological illness runs in his family, which \"really affected my life choices,\" he said. So he focused on other people's children instead, determined to pass his own passion for science on to them. The little ones who watched his show became the young adults who would march beside him. \"The scope of it is really astonishing,\" he said, with more awe than swagger. \"There are millions of kids who watched the show. I'm very proud of that.\" He smiled slightly. \"But I don't think I quite get it.\" 1 of 35 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The scene at the March for Science in D.C.

But then it's the day of the march, and he's in a white van driving him and the other event leaders to the starting point, and the streets are lined with signs that say \"Science, not Silence\" and \"Facts Matter,\" and maybe he's starting to get it a little bit more. [The best signs from the March for Science around the world] \"Look! This is so, so freaking cool,\" he says, pointing out the window. \"Look at all the people,\" he says when he steps outside, and again when he takes his place behind the big \"March for Science\" banner and starts shuffling down Constitution Avenue beneath a steady rain. \"Can I get a picture? I became a scientist because of you,\" a young woman asks him, and Nye puts his arm over her shoulders. It ends just before 3 p.m. in front of the Capitol Building, where the massive crowd gathers around Nye and his fellow co-chairs for one last group photo. \"Can we get a thank you for Bill Nye?\" one man bellows, and another adds: \"Bill Nye, you're the voice of a generation!\" The chant starts up again: \"Bill! Bill! Bill!\" Nye bows his head slightly, then raises his hand into the air, three fingers outstretched. It's the motion of a teacher trying to quiet a classroom, reminding his students to focus - not on him, but on what he taught them. He counts down: \"Three, two, one!\" And they answer in heartfelt unison: \"SCIENCE!\"",

For Chemistry?\n\nNye's unique gift is to communicate, to make what seems daunting to non-scientists less so. He reverses Clarke's Third Law, - Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic -  by pulling back the curtain and showing how the universe pulls the rabbit out of the hat.  That has been, throughout history, a rare and wondrous gift. It's been celebrated. It's been persecuted. \n\nAnd it has inspired millions.\n\nCan you say you've done as much?", 
                "I respect your opinion pertaining to Mr. Nye, but don't share it. I believe he is a phony who knows nothing about science, therefore, his ability to communicate novice scientific ideas and interests are as relevant to me as Hemingway giving his opinion on the nature and future of the universe.",

            "body": "Alisyn Camerota left Fox News in March 2014 without another job lined up. She had spent 16 years at the network, working as a correspondent, a co-host of \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" and a daytime news host. There was no good official explanation surrounding her departure. \"From her days reporting, to hosting Fox & Friends and anchoring afternoon programs, she has done it all with enthusiasm and professionalism. We appreciate her contributions to the network and hope for all the best as she embarks on the next chapter of her life,\" read a statement from Bill Shine, then the network's executive vice president of programming (he's now the co-president of Fox News). In her own missive to colleagues, Camerota mentioned Roger Ailes, the Fox News founder who was ousted last summer amid a sexual-harassment scandal. \"I want to thank Roger Ailes for having me as part of the FOX family and giving me many amazing opportunities to grow. Roger taught me a lifetime of valuable things about what makes great television,\" wrote Camerota. Several months later, Camerota caught on with CNN, where she co-hosts the morning program \"New Day\" along with Chris Cuomo. And three years after leaving Fox News, Camerota is now ready to speak in non-PR terms about it. In an interview with CNN colleague Brian Stelter, host of \"Reliable Sources,\" Camerota talked about her treatment at the hands of Ailes, who is alleged to have sexually harassed a couple of dozen women over the course of his career; he has denied all the allegations against him. Early in her Fox News career, Camerota tells Stelter, she went to Ailes with a request for a bigger portfolio at Fox News. The response from the boss squares with other accounts that surfaced in the summer of 2016: \"Well, I would have to work with you,'\" responded Ailes. \"I would have to work with you on that case. I would have to work with you really closely, and it may require us getting to know each other better, and that might have to happen away from here, and it might have to happen at a hotel. Do you know what I'm saying?\" And I said, 'Yeah. I think I do know what you're saying.' \" Camerota refused the advance. \"But I didn't know what that meant for me and for my career. And I remember vividly that I had sort of an out-of-body experience hovering over us in the office and thinking, 'Is this it? Is this the end of my time here? Will I be fired if I don't do this?' \" No, as it turned out. Camerota went on to a rather mediocre career at Fox News, never quite piercing the inner ring of hosting talent at the network. She did her work at \"Fox & Friends Weekend,\" a backwater of the worst franchise in all of television news. She filled in at the weekday version - again, the most execrable of all televised news offerings in the United States. She co-hosted an afternoon news program. And there things stood at the time of her departure. Could her stalled career prospects have stemmed from her having spurned Roger Ailes? That's not entirely clear, though Camerota did cite another element of friction in her interactions with Ailes. \"It was sort of emotional harassment. Roger Ailes ruled with an iron fist, and he wanted us all to fall in line and have his worldview and say the things that he wanted us to say on Fox News,\" said the former Fox News host. \"He targeted me because he sort of figured out early on that I didn't share his worldview. And he said, 'You're not saying the conservative things that I want you to say, and you could be a real role model, and you could be a real star if only you could sound conservative sometimes.' I said 'Uh. Well, Roger, that's not my job. I'm not supposed to sound conservative or liberal. I am supposed to be a fair and balanced, in your terms, journalist, and I'm supposed to be open, and I'm not supposed to take a side.\" This counterargument didn't impress the boss, according to Camerota: \"That, he didn't appreciate or particularly like. I was often, you know, sort of called on the carpet for things because he thought that I wasn't reflecting the conservative agenda, so he and I had a lot of interaction and sometimes arguments. Sometimes, he would lecture me. Sometimes, he would insult me,\" said the CNN host. When Camerota noted that her role is to play devil's advocate and take the \"other side,\" \"He said, 'There is no other side.' In Roger's worldview, there was no other side. Liberals were always wrong, conservatives were generally right, and that's what he felt that we should be reflecting on the air, and so when I say that there was bullying, it was very unpleasant at times to be alone in Roger's office when he would, you know, boom and bellow at me about how I was getting it wrong.\" For those seeking to understand why something such as Obamacare never stood a chance on Fox News, just mark Camerota's words. Susan Estrich, an attorney for Ailes, tells this blog: \"These are unsubstantiated and false allegations. Mr Ailes never engaged in the inappropriate conversations she now claims occurred, and he vigorously denies this fictional account of her interactions with him and of Fox News editorial policy.\" In a measure of further pushback, Estrich cites previous and very favorable comments that Camerota had made about Fox News, including a short profile that described her as having \"loved\" her time at the network. Another entry in Estrich's case-building is the glowing comments that Camerota made about Ailes upon her departure from Fox News. Let's not hold those comments against Camerota. The television industry - like many white-collar industries - is addicted to phony assertions of glee driven by public-relations imperatives. That Camerota said nice things about Fox News means only that she was seeking to extend her TV career. Or perhaps she was complying with the terms of her departure from Fox News. Consider the case of Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News star who ditched the network for a job at NBC News. Over the course of her career at Fox News, she made extravagant claims about Ailes's sound mentoring and influence on her career. And then, after Ailes was named in a sexual-harassment suit from former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson, Kelly came forward to tell her own story, which involved Ailes pursuing her about a decade ago. When the full weight of Kelly's allegations came packed inside Kelly's 2016 memoir, Estrich released this statement: \"This is what Ms. Kelly had to say about Roger Ailes only one year ago on the Charlie Rose program, 'I really care about Roger. And he has been nothing but good to me. And he's been very loyal. And he's had my back. And he's looked out for me.' Mr. Ailes denies her allegations of sexual harassment or misconduct of any kind.\" In explaining why she's telling her story now, Camerota cited the cataclysmic events of this past week, in which star host Bill O'Reilly found himself relieved of his job as the Fox News \"table setter\" following a series of sexual-harassment allegations. A trio of Murdochs - Rupert and his sons James and Lachlan - reached that pivotal decision. \"When Roger Ailes was ousted in July, there was a lot of talk about what the culture was there, and now, with Bill O'Reilly having been fired, it feels as though, if I take the Murdochs at their word, they really want to know what was wrong there and what the culture was like, and I don't know how you get that from silence. So, it feels like this might be the right time to just have this conversation and let some daylight in.\" Last summer the Fox News-Murdoch team moved swiftly against Ailes, forcing him out in the same month that Carlson's suit was filed. And this past week, they scrambled to dismiss O'Reilly and patch up the resulting hole in the network's prime-time lineup. The women who've worked with these fellows, however, are on their own schedule. They're telling their stories when they're ready, and all of them deserve to be heard.",

So either Kelly slept her way to the top, something she has not acknowledged, or she worked her way there. Something Camerota could also have done. Factor this in: asking for more money is not a good negotiating strategy. First you work your butt off and earn progressively more trust and air time. If you are successful and have enough of a following that you become attractive to other networks, THEN you can negotiate from a position of strength a \"larger portfolio\" and say things on air that might not be completely OK with management.

            "body": "CAMP LEMONNIER, Djibouti - After years of relative calm, piracy is on the rise again off the coast of Somalia, U.S. officials here said Sunday. Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, the Marine officer in charge of the U.S. Africa Command, said there have been \"five or six\" piracy incidents in the region in two months. Waldhauser, speaking at a news conference here with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, attributed the spike in attacks to the widespread drought and famine gripping the region. He said the ships the pirates were targeting have been small in size and carried goods such as food and oil. \"I wouldn't say it's a trend, but we'll watch it,\" he said. [Somali pirates just hijacked a commercial ship for the first time in five years] After a coordinated international response to piracy in 2010 and 2011, including additional patrols of U.S. and European naval ships in the waters around Somalia, the number of pirate attacks in the past five years has been negligible. That has changed in recent months. \"It has certainly increased,\" said Navy Capt. Richard Rodriguez, chief of staff of the U.S. task force in the Horn of Africa. Rodriguez told reporters that the U.S. task force has a monitoring role, while local authorities and units led by the European Union take the lead in assessing the resurgent threat. [Everyone thought the Somali pirate threat had ended. Then a tanker was attacked.] An Indian ship was hijacked by pirates this month, just weeks after an oil tanker was seized in nearby waters. In 2011, there were more than 230 pirate attacks off the coast of Somalia, according to the International Maritime Bureau. In the years since, shipping companies have increased security measures, including using anti-boarding devices and armed contractors to deter pirates. A defense official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, partially attributed the recent spike in pirate activity to complacency among shipping companies, saying they may have relaxed their security procedures in recent years because of the reduction in threat. Mattis told reporters that the Pentagon would monitor the situation and that measures undertaken by shipping lines appear to be sufficient. \"I don't see a big military role,\" he added. [The economics of Somali piracy] Mattis's visit marks the first time a high-ranking Trump administration official has visited Africa and comes as the U.S. military increases pressure on militant groups in the region. In March, President Trump gave the Pentagon new authority to conduct airstrikes against the terrorist group al-Shabab in Somalia, and the U.S. military has conducted about 70 airstrikes against al-Qaeda fighters in Yemen in two months. Camp Lemonnier, the only permanent U.S. base in Africa, also has continued to expand. In the past 15 years, the base has transformed from an austere Marine outpost to a sprawling military installation with 4,000 U.S. troops and dorm-style barracks. Nearby, the Air Force operates an independent drone base. The United States pays $65 million a year to Djibouti's government to use Lemonnier. The base's name is derived from a French Foreign Legion outpost built in the same area in the 1950s. The base's strategic location on the Horn of Africa has made it central for U.S. forces in the Middle East and Africa, including help with missions in Yemen and Somalia. Lemonnier also sits just south of the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, a key choke point between the Horn of Africa and the Middle East that has been the scene of recent naval hostility between Yemeni Houthi rebels and Saudi forces. While Lemonnier is located near French, Italian and Japanese bases, a new Chinese outpost has raised concern among some U.S. officials. The base, an hour's boat ride north, is under construction and is likely be used as a hub to help transit natural resources from the continent back to China. Currently, Marine aircraft from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit are staged at Lemonnier to help with operations in the region. The base also serves as a transit hub for U.S. forces working in Somalia. The contingent of about 100 troops there has attempted to bolster the fledging Somali military and its efforts against al-Shabab militants before a coalition of African countries, called AMISOM, fighting al-Shabab withdraws in 2018. U.S. officials, however, have suggested that AMISOM's withdrawal could be contingent on the Somali military's ability to conduct operations without support. According to Rodriguez, there are about 22,000 AMISOM troops in Somalia and 12,000 Somali troops. The Somali military would have to be about the same size as the current AMISOM contingent to effectively counter al-Shabab militants, he said.",

The Alabama-born, guitar-dependent combo both thrilled and wore out their audience Friday at the 9:30 Club, with a 2 \u00bd -hour set full of progressive political messages put to a retro Southern rock beat. The Truckers played several tracks from their 11th and latest album, \"American Band.\" In the best of the new tunes offered, \"Ever South,\" Patterson Hood sang about the urge to hang on to one's roots, whether immigrating from Ireland or migrating from the American Deep South to the Great Northwest, as he and his family recently did with a cross-country move to Portland. The most righteous newbie was \"What It Means,\" a bouncy tune in which Hood, singing with a Black Lives Matter poster behind him onstage, sought lessons from the killings of Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin. Co-founding Trucker Mike Cooley, who alternated as lead singer with Hood, countered with \"Ramon Casiano,\" a story song about a Mexican teenager murdered in a Texas border town in 1931; the killer, Harlon Carter, not only went unpunished but was later named head of the National Rifle Association. The Truckers' performance was hardly overwhelmed by piousness, however. Chestnuts such as Cooley's \"Marry Me\" showed the band's debt to the Rolling Stones, while Hood led Southern rock takes on Bruce Springsteen's \"State Trooper\" and Prince's \"Sign o' the Times.\" There were also lots of vintage homages to Lynyrd Skynyrd, the biggest band in Alabama rock history even though they were from another state. The Truckers sang \"Ronnie and Neil,\" a power-chord rocker that enhances the relationship - personal and attitudinal - between Skynyrd frontman Ronnie Van Zant and Neil Young, the latter of whom sang derisively about the Deep South in the early 1970s, and thereby inspired some of Van Zant's best work. And, of course, the Truckers played their theme song, \"Let There Be Rock,\" the three-guitar centerpiece of \"Southern Rock Opera,\" the band's transcendent 2001 concept album about coming of age in the land of George Wallace during the heyday of Skynyrd. They also performed \"Get On the Plane,\" a rock shuffle full of Cooley's observations about how life and death are driven by destiny, so there's little use in letting fear ruin a good time. But obligations to babysitters, Metro schedules or maybe even just fatigue appeared to get in the way of many folks' ability to stick around till the show's end. At least one-third of the audience that packed the club at the beginning of the night was gone by the time the Truckers' set ended with \"Hell No I Ain't Happy.\" The die-hards who had stood through it all screamed along to every last chorus. There was no encore.",

            "body": "Beware Mike Babcock. (Molly Riley/Associated Press) TORONTO - You can't blame Toronto Coach Mike Babcock for his confidence and positive thinking. As he exited Verizon Center on Friday night, his team on the brink of elimination after a 2-1 overtime loss in Washington, he assured arena staff on his way out that he'd be back for a Game 7. \"See you in a couple days.\" Mike Babcock said this to every staff-member at Verizon Center as he walked to the team bus. - Jonas Siegel (@jonassiegel) April 22, 2017 \"They were being nice to me on the way out, saying have a good year,\" Babcock said on Saturday. \"I said, 'No, see you in a couple of days.' In my mind and in my heart, that's what I know is going to happen.\" The Capitals respect that Babcock should have that sort of determined message with his Maple Leafs team. \"We'd be probably saying the same thing if we were in his situation,\" Washington defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk said. But with a three-games-to-two series lead entering Sunday night's Game 6, the Capitals aren't in Toronto's desperate situation, so they're not too concerned with the Maple Leafs' comments. \"We're ready to go home and say hello to the Verizon guys on Monday as well, just getting ready for series two,\" Shattenkirk said. [After struggling on faceoffs to start the series, the Capitals have rebounded] Shattenkirk was then asked if there are mind games being played with the talk coming out of both locker rooms. \"You try to as much as you can,\" Shattenkirk said. \"It seems like been trying to do that a lot. And he's someone who loves doing it. So, it's always fun. You know in the locker room when it's being played and you just kind of give it a chuckle.\" Babcock's gamesmanship arguably started early, when he played up the narrative of pressure for a favored team like the Capitals before the series even started. \"That 'pucker factor' is an unbelievable thing,\" Babcock said then. \"Until you've been the best seed, until you have your whole city expecting, you don't know what's that like and how good a defense that is for the underdog. It's unbelievable. So my first year in Detroit, I'd never experienced anything like it and I couldn't believe how we couldn't skate or pass. So pressure's a wonderful thing when you're the underdog.\" Capitals Coach Barry Trotz's response? \"I listened to Babs' comments, he's playing you guys with that,\" he said. Things have taken a macabre turn recently with the Maple Leafs on the brink of elimination and the Capitals 1-5 since 2010 in their attempts to close out a series in Game 6 when they've had the lead. \"They are going to come with their absolute best, and we're going to have to come with our absolute best game,\" Trotz said. \"You get an opportunity to push someone off a cliff, you need to push them off if you can. The difference is we've got a little bit of wiggle room. They don't.\" Said Babcock: \"When you have someone down and you have a chance to step on him, you step on him. Or they might get up and kill you, you know what I mean? I agree with him 100 percent. We're the same thing. We don't win, we go home. There should be no more desperate team than us. We're all aware and understand that fully.\"",

            "body": "He hadn't yet buried his sister. She'd died, suddenly and unexpectedly, just a few days earlier. But there he was a couple months ago, in the first, raw stage of grief, back in the office - a colleague of mine, just the same as we witnessed of Boston Celtics superstar guard Isaiah Thomas over the past week. It was the most emotional of moments any of us experience, and most all us do so out of the view of others - all but athletes, who bare their heartache in the most public of squares. For Thomas, it came a week ago Sunday, as he sat on the Celtics' bench in Boston before their opening playoff game against the Chicago Bulls. A television camera invaded his moment. It captured his blank stare through reddened eyes, his hand wiping away tears as fast as they streamed down his cheeks, an arm from one member of his basketball family wrapped around his shoulder in a gesture of consolation. Just a day before, Thomas learned that his younger sister, Chyna, died in a car accident in their home state of Washington. ['RIP Lil Sis': Celtics star 'struggling' but plays in Game 1] Thomas was about to do what we marvel at athletes doing all the time. We call it playing through pain. A broken bone. A badly pulled muscle. A twisted ankle. Martin St. Louis, above, Brett Favre and Jeannie Rochette have had memorable moments in their sports shortly after losing a loved one. It reminds us how normal and devoid of shame it is grieve, Kevin B. Blackistone writes. (Chris Szagola/Associated Press) But playing through the pain of mental anguish, having just lost a loved one, is the most acute of all. \"The general public is expected to take time off to grieve,\" Stephany Coakley, a Washington-based sports psychologist who coaches athletes in mental toughness, reminded me last week. \"Almost all employers provide bereavement leave. The expectation is that athletes can play and perform through the pain. The expectation probably exists because so many athletes have done so in the past.\" In the middle of the 2104 Stanley Cup playoffs, Martin St. Louis, then starring for the New York Rangers, learned that his mother, France, suffered a fatal heart attack. Three days later, on Mother's Day, he suited up in Madison Square Garden and scored the first goal of the game. On the eve of a Monday Night Football game just before Christmas in 2003, quarterback Brett Favre found out that his father, Irv, suddenly died. Favre turned out on national TV, nonetheless. He threw for 399 yards and four touchdowns to lead his Packers over Oakland. [Wilbon: The son rises in mourning] I remember most vividly Joannie Rochette, a Canadian figure skater, at the 2010 Winter Olympics in her home country. Two days before her short program, Rochette's mother, Therese, who introduced her to skating and shepherded at every point through her career, suffered a massive heart attack and died just hours after landing in Vancouver, the site of the Games. Rochette decided to skate. As Rochette skated onto the ice, alone, for her program, such a hush enveloped the arena that it seemed you could hear the breathing of others if you held your own breath. A few minutes later, as Rochette finished skating to the Uruguayan tango, La Cumparsita, whose lyrics begin, \"The little parade of endless miseries,\" she dropped her head and melted into tears as a standing ovation drowned out thousands of witnesses sniffling with tears. Rochette was awarded bronze. Isaiah Thomas has returned to the court for the Celtics, grieving in the public eye when many employees are permitted bereavement leave. (Maddie Meyer/Getty Images) It was the sort of moment - as are these all - that elicited the cliche about sports and life that always disturbs me. It's the one that says that such horrible news puts sports and what is really important in life into perspective, as if the two are mutually exclusive or sport doesn't measure up to importance at all. It brings to mind a passage in an award-winning 2009 autobiography, \"Come What May,\" by an Irish hurling star named D\u00f3nal \u00d3g Cusack about what sport means. \"When we die someone will say piously that death or illness puts all the hurling into perspective,\" Cusack wrote, \"as if our departed comrade had put his life into something trivial and wasteful.\" There really isn't much trivial about sport, given that we see so much in it about how we behave, how we relate and who we are. We're often drawn to it because we live vicariously through it. And when Joannie Rochette, or Isaiah Thomas, wept before us, uncontrollably and unapologetically, it was a reminder of how normal and devoid of shame it is to do this most human thing: grieve. \"I couldn't have imagined a day where my little sister, Chyna, wouldn't be here,\" Thomas said in a statement released in the middle of last week. \"She and my family are everything to me, so the pain I am feeling right now is impossible to put into words. This has been without question the hardest week in my life. At the same time, I have been overwhelmed by the love and support that I have received and couldn't be more thankful for my friends, family, fans, the City of Boston, Celtics organization and NBA community. I truly appreciate all of the support you've shown me the past several days and thank you for respecting my privacy as I continue to grieve and heal with my loved ones at this time.\" [Celtics' Thomas: Days since sister died hardest of my life] Thomas was having a season that was etching him into the wall of the greatest Celtics players. Despite standing just 5 feet 9, he averaged 28.9 points during the regular season, or nearly as many as Celtics Hall of Fame legend Larry Bird's career high. He became the most lethal scorer in the NBA's fourth quarter, when so many games are won or lost. But he most likely will be remembered in Boston after this season for the sadness through which he played in its playoffs. It is the kind of thing that in the past created an aura around the athletes who endure it and turned them into folk heroes. Suddenly, they are no longer playing for themselves, or even the team, but for some greater purpose, for a lost loved one. \"I knew that my dad would have wanted me to play,\" Favre said after the game. \"When athletes perform at a high level while in the initial stages of grief, it reinforces society's belief that athletes have something special,\" Coakley said. \"But what many elite athletes have is mental toughness, resilience, discipline and support not only from family, but their teammates, the organization and, yes, us in the adoring general public.\" But don't conflate an athlete's ability to compartmentalize grief and performance, often extraordinarily, with invincibility. They are no different from us. We just witness their pain. Kevin B.

            "body": "PARIS - The crusading French politician Marine Le Pen hates being called a far-right leader. She says if most French voters endorse her harsh anti-immigration plans, that means she is a centrist. After her breakthrough result Sunday in the first round of France's presidential elections, Le Pen will put that view to the test. The leader of a once-fringe party shadowed by its defense of World War II-era Nazi collaboration is just one round of ballots away from a backflip into the center of her nation's political life. [France's National Front co-founder Jean-Marie Le Pen says the battle is already won] If Le Pen captures the Elys\u00e9e Palace on May 7, it will be a dramatic turnabout for a fiery leader whose bid for France's leadership was unimaginable a few years ago. But after a wave of bloody terrorist attacks, a surge of refugees and the aching sense that France's identity is slipping away, many voters appear ready to imagine the woman with the cigarette-tanned voice as their president.  \"We cannot afford to lose this war. But for the past 10 years, left-wing and right-wing governments have done everything they can for us to lose it,\" Le Pen said days before the election, after a French citizen killed a police officer and wounded two more on the landmark Champs-Elysees- boulevard in an attack for which the Islamic State asserted responsibility. \"We need a presidency that acts and protects us,\" she said. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) The violence played perfectly into the warnings of a woman who has been sounding the alarm for years that France's identity was slipping away to Muslims - even before a recent spate of terrorist attacks sent France into an official state of emergency. Even Socialist President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande briefly toyed with stripping dual citizens of their French nationality if they were convicted of terrorism charges, a signature Le Pen idea that critics said would relegate many French Muslims to second-class citizenship. [Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen: 'We've won the battle of ideas'] Born into a political family, the 48-year-old Le Pen was for decades among her father's closest confidantes as Jean-Marie Le Pen led his National Front party as an eccentric gathering of extremist politicians who thought that the Holocaust was just \"a detail\" of World War II. Over the decades, he became the living emblem of Europe's far-right politicians: cranky, offensive, tinged with the odor of being a Nazi sympathizer, but always far from power. The daughter's political awakening came when she was 8, she has said, after the family's modest apartment was bombed and officials appeared to do little to find the culprit. The front of the building was blown off. No one died, but a baby survived only because a tree slowed its fall. \"We were not treated the same as others,\" she wrote in her 2006 autobiography, blaming official indifference on her father's political views. But if her father was willing to give up ballot-box success in the name of ideological purity, Le Pen has proven a far more adept politician. When Jean-Marie Le Pen slipped into the second round of the presidential election in 2002, there was little question that voters on both sides of the political spectrum would band together to defeat him. He captured less than 18 percent of the vote, a crushing disappointment for a daughter who trained as a lawyer but spent the bulk of her career working inside the party. [Marine Le Pen wants to be France's future. But can she escape the past?] This time, there is little expectation that voters will reject Le Pen simply because of the party's past association with Nazism. After the 2002 loss, the younger Le Pen vowed to transform the movement into a force that could actually win elections. She took over the party in 2011 and quickly moved to distance it from its roots. She said she was the best ally of France's Jews - because she would protect them against Muslim immigrants. She made a bid for left-behind union members, the core of France's old left-wing alliance, by saying that she would protect their cherished social benefits by turning back the forces of globalization. And in a father-daughter drama worthy of Shakespeare, she expelled her father from the party after his views about the Holocaust became a distraction on the campaign trail. They say they no longer talk - although the elder Le Pen is still financing his daughter's bid. Now she is a sizzling sparkplug on the campaign trail, firing up crowds who say none of the other contenders has anything fresh to say. Before the first round, the mood at her rallies was in sharp contrast to her now-vanquished opponents, who sometimes seemed to struggle to indicate to crowds when they were supposed to cheer. She has gathered supporters from across France's hard-hit north, where once-proud factories have been shuttered as jobs moved to Poland and China.  \"My project is to give France its liberty back, to let it out of jail, to give you France back and to give France back to the world,\" Le Pen said to wild applause at her final Paris rally last week. \"It is high time to set France free.\" [Charles de Gaulle would roll over in his grave over what has become of French politics] But if she wins, the France she would create could look radically different from the multicultural, plugged-into-Europe nation it is today. Le Pen has vowed to erect border barriers and bar immigration both from inside and outside Europe. She says she would rebuild French manufacturing, which has struggled under competition from cheaper foreign goods, by seeking to bring back the French franc. And she has listed a host of tactics she would use to make France less hospitable to its Muslim population, including the serving of pork in schools and the expulsion of any noncitizen who had been flagged for extra monitoring under France's anti-terror regime. Critics say her tactics would range from unconstitutional to inhumane, and they warn that the financial panic unleashed by any attempt to leave the European Union would knock down her already-struggling supporters. She says that the tide of history is on her side, pointing to the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and the election of President Trump as signs that voters around the world are rejecting globalization and immigration. Trump's main failing so far, Le Pen said this month, is that he is turning into a conventional politician, and not upholding his more extreme campaign promises. \"He is in contradiction with the commitments he made,\" she told France Info radio. \"I am coherent. I don't change my mind in a few days.\" Read more Marine Le Pen: France 'not responsible' for deporting Jews during Holocaust What to watch for in the first round of the French presidential election A youth revolt in France boosts the far right Today's coverage from Post correspondents around the world Like Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news",

(Alex Brandon/AP) Attorney General Jeff Sessions drew ire last week after he referred to Hawaii as \"an island in the Pacific,\" expressing amazement that a federal judge on a district court there could block President Trump's travel ban. \"I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and constitutional power,\" Sessions told radio host Mark Levin on Wednesday. People, especially those from Hawaii, were not amused. Lawmakers from the state (the 50th in the union, to be exact) called out the nation's top law enforcement official on Twitter, one likening his comments to \"dog whistle politics.\" Mr. Attorney General: You voted for that judge.

In a column, The Washington Post's Gene Park blasted Sessions's comments as \"peak colonialism.\" The New York Times published a primer: \"What Is Hawaii?\" \"You may have questions about Hawaii,\" the Times piece stated. \"Many Americans do.\" Less than a week later, Sessions doesn't seem fazed by the uproar over his remarks. The attorney general appeared Sunday on ABC's \"This Week,\" where host George Stephanopoulos asked him to respond to the controversy over the remarks. At first, Sessions did not answer directly, instead he started to talk about the lawsuit that had been filed against the executive order. \"Why not just call it the state of Hawaii?\" Stephanopoulos pressed. Sessions chuckled. \"Nobody has a sense of humor anymore,\" Sessions said, smiling.

The president has to deal with the Department of Defense, the national intelligence agencies, CIA. He knows the threats to this country. He is responsible for protecting America,\" Sessions told Stephanopoulos. \"This order is lawful. It's within his authority constitutionally and explicit statutory authority. We're going to defend that order all the way up. And so you do have a situation in which one judge out of 700 in America has stopped this order. \"I think it's a mistake. And we're going to battle in the courts, and I think we'll eventually win.\" In the wake of the backlash over Sessions's comments last week, the Justice Department tried to clarify his wording. \"Hawaii is, in fact, an island in the Pacific - a beautiful one where the Attorney General's granddaughter was born,\" Justice Department spokesman Ian D. Prior said in a statement. \"The point, however, is that there is a problem when a flawed opinion by a single judge can block the President's lawful exercise of authority to keep the entire country safe.\" [Hawaii residents to Jeff Sessions: 'We're not just some island'] But even that, as many pointed out, was geographically incorrect. Hawaii is an archipelago of eight major islands, one of which is named \"Hawaii\" - but not the one on which Judge Derrick K. Watson, the federal judge in question, resides. (That is Oahu.) On Friday, Sessions refused to apologize for his comments in an interview with CNN's Kate Bolduan. \"No, I wasn't criticizing the judge or the island. I think it's a fabulous place,\" Sessions told Bolduan, still incorrectly referring to the state as a single island. \"I've got a granddaughter born there.\" \"Do you wish you had phrased it differently now?\" Bolduan asked again a short while later. \"I don't know that I said anything that I would want to phrase differently,\" Sessions told Bolduan. \"No.\" The Post's Matt Zapotosky explains why a federal judge in Hawaii on March 15 ruled to freeze President Trump's second travel ban hours before it went into effect.

Heir to the throne Prince William, his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, and younger brother Prince Harry joined members of a mental-health charity watching the race on a corner in the capital. (Reuters) A runner paused to do something nearly unthinkable for a competitive athlete in an important race as he neared the finish line of the London Marathon on Sunday. Before a royal audience and thousands of onlookers, he slowed, sacrificing his own precious seconds, to help a struggling runner, whose legs were about to buckle, cross the line. Matthew Rees, competing with the Swansea Harriers running club, stopped just short of finishing the 26.2-mile race to help David Wyeth of Chorlton Runners, who was clearly in trouble. A race official was also quick to help at the finish line just outside Buckingham Palace and Wyeth received immediate attention from paramedics. This is incredible!

In his book, \"The Last Lynching in Northern Virginia,\" he explored the hanging and subsequent burning of the black man - and his attack on a white couple that preceded it. But Hall, who worked for the Fredericksburg Free Lance-Star for 26 years, says that getting the book sold or publicly discussed in Fauquier has been a seven-month struggle. \"I've been really disappointed and surprised,\" Hall said of a response that seemed to say, \"Why would you revive such an awful incident?\" Former newspaper reporter Jim Hall's book tells about a lynching in Fauquier County, Va. (Suzanne Carr Rossi) The book was published in September by South Carolina-based History Press. Soon after, he began to get the discouraging drift. A sales rep said shopkeepers didn't want to carry it. A Warrenton museum - the logical place to find it - decided not to stock it, after a divided board vote. And while Hall was making the rounds of other Virginia towns for author talks, \"no church or civic group stepped forward\" to host him in Fauquier. \"We couldn't penetrate the area,\" said History Press's Megan Petrie. \"It was just too sensitive a topic.\" Robert Marquart, the sales rep who made the rounds of pharmacies and shops last fall, described the reaction: \"They just weren't keen to carry it.\" Yet local people did show interest when the slim volume was made available. \"The Fauquier libraries had one copy in each branch, and there's never not been a waiting list,\" Hall said. And when a Warrenton hardware store took a chance and stocked it, Hall said, the proprietor \"held his breath\" about the possible reaction - and the book sold out. To be sure, the history excavated in the book is disturbing in many ways. The story begins with the abduction and rape of a white woman, Mamie Baxley, who was asleep when 39-year-old Thompson attacked her and her husband, Henry. Their toddler son slept in the next room. Thompson, a World War I veteran, knew the family well: He lived next door in a tenant house; he worked for them as a farmhand and his wife as a cook. His motive remains a mystery. After the attack, Thompson fled, and a manhunt went on for weeks, involving hundreds of volunteers, many of them armed. They found nothing. But two months after the assault, a farmhand found Thompson's body hanging from an apple tree. Hall's book tells what happened next, as a crowd gathered: \"Despite the presence of a deputy sheriff, members of the mob set fire to the body, destroying everything but the skull. They also removed Thompson's teeth as souvenirs.\" The county coroner ruled that his death was a suicide - Thompson, he said, had climbed onto the tree, attached a rope to his neck and jumped. A county grand jury confirmed it, but soon, civil rights groups and local newspapers saw it for what it was: a lynching followed by a coverup. Former governor Harry F. Byrd came down on the side of suicide. \"With no trial and no public explanation, the official verdict stood,\" Hall wrote. His conclusion: \"Thompson did not commit suicide. . . . He was captured and killed by a posse of his neighbors, the victim of Virginia's last lynching.\" Karen Hughes White, the co-founder of the Afro-American Historical Association of Fauquier County, understands the resistance that such a story may engender. \"Sometimes people are in denial. They want to think none of this ever happened here,\" she told me. But she's also found openness: \"I've heard people say they never thought about these issues. We're trying to allow people to think and to allow conversation.\" Her museum has stocked 25 copies of Hall's book and will host a presentation on May 13. And a related documentary film by Tom Davenport, \"The Other Side of Eden,\" will be screened that evening at a Warrenton arts center. This kind of interest and possible acceptance has been a long time coming, Hall said. \"I have spoken in Richmond, Culpeper, Manassas, Stafford and Fredericksburg about the book and about lynching in Virginia,\" but never before in Fauquier County, the scene of the crimes. Hall said he is heartened that the Old Jail Museum in Warrenton, which voted last year not to allow the book's sale, has begun carrying it - seven months after publication. In a foreword, University of Mary Washington history professor Claudine Ferrell writes that Thompson's murder was one of many like it - lynchings peaked in the 1890s at about 200 a year. Over the years, murders by mobs in Mississippi alone took more than 500 black lives. She sees Hall's book as a valuable part of \"clarifying the history of race, justice and community in American history.\" Hall's honest accounting - and the painful discussions it is sure to provoke - may help heal the wound.

            "body": "Centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron and French far-right leader Marine Le Pen advanced to a runoff in France's presidential election on April 23, according to initial exit polls. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) In French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, many have seen a sort of Donald Trump lite - an isolationist candidate with a populist message and an anti-immigrant stance. And many have prognosticated that Le Pen and Trump are part of a transatlantic mutual admiration society. Le Pen was photographed eating ice cream at Trump Tower. Trump told the Associated Press that Le Pen is \"the strongest on what's been going on in France.\" Le Pen paid Trump the biggest compliment a politician can receive: If she were American, he'd have her vote. So when Trump penned a tweet saying that last week's terrorist attack in Paris would have a \"big effect\" on the presidential election, many saw it as support for Le Pen. Then Reince Priebus went on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday. [The French see echoes of the U.S. elections in their own] The president's chief of staff was the first in the administration to address the tweet directly - and to try to back off the foregone conclusion that Trump strongly supports Le Pen. His answer: \"No, not at all.\" Another terrorist attack in Paris. The people of France will not take much more of this. Will have a big effect on presidential election! - Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2017 According to a transcript, Priebus told host Chuck Todd that Trump \"is going to support whoever the winner is. We've got a long-term relationship that's historical with the French people and the French government. No matter who wins, that relationship is going to continue.\" Le Pen and centrist Emmanuel Macron claimed victory in France's election on Sunday, and both are headed to a runoff on May 7. [What you need to know about the French presidential election] The Washington Post's Aaron Blake wrote that Trump was playing a political game in which \"politicians say nice things about other politicians but insist they aren't 'endorsing' them.\" Marine Le Pen. (Michel Euler/AP) \"While the media often handicaps foreign elections and candidates' strengths and weaknesses - it's part of our job - presidents and other world leaders avoid doing so for fear of looking like they are trying to tip the scales in another country,\" Blake wrote. \"Trump also just happened to underscore an issue that he feels is of the utmost importance - it was the subject of his first controversial executive action, the travel ban - and then pointed to Le Pen as clearly the best candidate on that issue. That's no coincidence.\" [Trump just admitted his presidency isn't going well - tacitly] In a rally in France last week, Le Pen gave a speech on immigration that could have been a Trump campaign rally cry if a few proper nouns were changed. \"Just watch the interlopers from all over the world come and install themselves in our home,\" she said, according to the New York Times article on the event. \"They want to transform France into a giant squat. ... But it's up to the owner to decide who can come in. So, our first act will be to restore France's frontiers.\" On Sunday, when pressed, Priebus conceded that Trump \"may have some opinions, as far as who he thinks might win. But he certainly doesn't have a preference, other than a right-of-center person who believes in the free market.\" Read more: The president accused Obama of 'McCarthyism.'

            "body": "The Music Box. That was the name of the record store I visited on my first day as a resident of Langley Park, Md., in 1980. Among the many people who reminded me of the name after my column last week was Faye Brown, daughter of the Music Box's late owner, Jerry Brown. She even remembered the girl I mentioned who once worked there, Terri. [Sub sandwiches, records and beer: Remembering Langley Park, Md., circa 1980] I don't care what people say. Washington is a small town. (And by \"Washington,\" I mean that city, along with all the hamlets that make up our entire area.) When we're young, geography informs memory. We mark our lives by the stores we shop at, the restaurants we visit, the bits of architecture we pass so often that they become ingrained in our brains, as fixed and reliable to us as a mountain range or a waterfall was to our Cro-Magnon forebears. So, for some of us, that seemingly immutable marker was the Music Box. \"It had a great neon sign that flashed a record back and forth,\" wrote a reader named Joel who lives in Deale, Md. \"As a collector of old Washington, D.C., junk, I wish I had tried to obtain the sign.\" For others of us, it was Waxie Maxies. (There was one in the shopping center on the other side of University Boulevard.) Or it was Penguin Feather or Kemp Mill Records or Harmony Hut or the Wiz. William Hoffman Jr. said the Music Box is where he bought his first album: \"Meet the Beatles.\" I bet that when a song from that album comes on the radio, William thinks not only of that particular song, but of that physical album - of holding the cover in his hands - and of the store where he bought that album. It's all tied up together. To live in one place for any stretch is to construct an imaginary scaffolding comprising time, place and action - and to decorate it with sense memories. My Langley Park recollections unleashed a flood of taste memories of an ice cream shop called Weile's Creations. It was in the shopping center catty-corner to the one with the Music Box. Founded by Eric Weile, a German Jew who had escaped the Nazis, Weile's was famous for its outlandish ice cream creations. (Even so, Robb Mapou said when he was a boy, he liked to get the Whipped Cream Supreme: \"nothing but whipped cream and sprinkles in a tall cup.\") Eric Weile died in 1980, and his ice cream shop is long gone, but you can find scans of his 16-page menu online, meaning it might be possible to reverse engineer such confections as the Drip, the Killer Diller and the Lincoln Memorial, which cost $30 and required a day's notice to construct. Our today is built upon the bones of yesterday. Michael Willis of Laurel, Md., remembered that the Kmart I mentioned had, before that, been an E.J. Korvettes. And before that, it had been a Lansburgh's, that homegrown department store. (Today the building houses a furniture store and mini-mall.) William Hoffman Jr. - he of the Music Box Beatles album - reminded me that the Langley Park liquor store I mentioned had a unique distinction: \"You could get liquor to go, and individual drinks to go. In a drive-through!\" You had to get out of the car to order at Famous Delicatessen, whose subs I devoured through college. Ben Klopman worked there between 1971 and 1980. \"I have fond memories of the Gruber family who owned the deli and its function as a gathering place of the various local business people in the area, many of whom were characters and were quite funny,\" Ben wrote. \"I know that 'you cannot go home again,' but I do wish that there still was a Famous Delicatessen so that I could show my children the deli that I worked at growing up, as I often share my memories of this time in my life with them.\" Memories. On my first day in Langley Park, I walked into the Music Box and asked Terri, the girl behind the counter, if the record store was hiring. I'd done the math and figured I was going to need to work at least 20 hours a week. No, Terri said, but she knew someplace that was. That's how I ended up in the shipping department of a photography lab up Route 29 called Colorfax, where for half my shift I wore white cotton gloves and slipped fresh prints inside envelopes, and for the other half I drove all over the area - from Fairfax to Baltimore - delivering them. But that's a story for another day. Twitter: @johnkelly For previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/johnkelly.",

                "We moved into a then-new apartment in the 8300 block of 14th Ave. in the summer of 1950.  All the kids waited each afternoon for the Good Humor man to come around because he would save Popsicle bags for us and then give them to the kid who guessed the \"secret number\".  When Byrd Stadium opened  September 30, 1950, with Maryland playing Navy, the roads in Langley Park were impossible that afternoon.  Opposite Weile's on University Blvd. (which may have still been call Old Bladensburg Road) was some kind of Catholic seminary.   In 1972 my future wife asked me to take her to see \"The Godfather\" at the Langley Theater.  It was the first major movie that opened in the suburbs rather than in downtown theaters.   LP has changed a lot since 1950 for sure."

            "body": "Tom Brady created his own foundation in 2005. (Darron Cummings/Associated Press) New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has used his superstardom to boost one of his pet charities, and it, in turn, has helped his with significant contributions, according to a detailed account by the Boston Globe. Brady has for years had a relationship with Best Buddies International, a nonprofit organization founded to help intellectually and developmentally disabled people, and has participated in an event with the group in the summer. Along the way, he has helped Best Buddies raise over $20 million over the last six years, the Globe's Bob Hohler reports, with Best Buddies paying $2.75 million to Brady's Change the World Foundation Trust. In addition, it has pledged another $500,000 in 2017. Brady, whom the Globe says is the only trustee of his private charity, initially funded it with a $490,000 donation in 2005 and has not made a significant financial contribution according to tax reports through 2015. Through 2015, the last year for which records are available, Best Buddies has supplied \"nearly 98 percent of Change the World's total contributions of $2.3 million since Brady's initial donation were $2.25 million in grants from Best Buddies. Including Brady's donation, the percentage is about 80 percent,\" Hohler writes. Brady has an estimated personal worth of $180 million, while his wife, supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen, is worth an estimated $360 million. According to independent charity watchdogs contacted by the Globe, it appears that there is nothing illegal with the arrangement. \"It is not unusual for nonprofits to pay celebrities to help raise money,\" one unnamed watchdog told the Globe, \"and they did not dispute that Best Buddies has realized an enviable return on its relationship with Brady.\" There is some question, though, whether Best Buddies should report the payments as fundraising expenses and not charitable gifts. \"I think it has been a smart move, because we have been able to provide services to tens of thousands of people because of Tom, while keeping him engaged and helping him pursue some of his own interests,\" Anthony K. Shriver, the Best Buddies founder and chairman, told the Globe, adding that there is no contract with Brady and that he is just expected to donate $500,000 annually to Brady's trust. \"It has been super beneficial to us and him.\" Where does the money in the Change the World Foundation Trust go? Junipero Serra High School, Brady's alma mater in San Mateo, Calif., received $250,000, the largest donation of the nearly $1 million given to 30 nonprofits from 2011 through 2015. The next largest grants, of $100,000 each, went to St. Monica Catholic Community in Santa Monica, Calif., where Brady and Bundchen were married, and the TB12 Foundation, formed by Brady in 2015 to support clients of his TB12 fitness and nutrition company. It also has donated to charities headed by some of Brady's teammates, as well as to private schools attended by Brady's children. Brady has not commented other than to say in a release by Best Buddies: \"This organization has become a part of my life. I love meeting the inspiring buddies at events, seeing their smiles, and hearing them talk about how Best Buddies has changed their lives for the better by helping them make friends at school and find meaningful jobs in their local communities. Best Buddies' mission is a simple one, but the impact is incredibly powerful. I am so grateful to be a part of this global movement.\" The arrangement was born out of the friendship between Brady and Shriver, who founded the organization in 1989. His late mother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founded the Special Olympics, and the cause has long been supported by the Kennedy family. Shriver told the Globe that, after volunteering his time and image to Best Buddies for years, Brady increasingly wanted to focus on his own foundation. Shriver told the Globe that he recalled Brady saying before payments began in 2011, \"When I come to Best Buddies events, it's all about Best Buddies, which is the way I want to keep it while I develop my interests. Would you support helping me pursue my things while I continue to put a lot of energy into your thing?' \"",

            "body": "Rory McIlroy, championship golfer, now is Rory McIlroy, newlywed husband. Talk about an unplayable lie. Rory, Rory, Rory - your idyllic life just went from a perpetual birdie opportunity to a potential triple bogey. McIlroy and Erica Stoll of Irondequoit, N.Y., got married Saturday at the five-star Ashford Castle near Cong, Ireland, in a large, lavish and celebrity-laden affair. (Couch Slouch can speak from experience here: The bigger the wedding, the shorter the marriage. These days when I get hitched, we're talking the drive-through window at City Hall, followed by a brief reception at a nearby bowling alley. Toni balked at this at the time, but now, when she's had her fill of me, she goes out and rolls three games!) McIlroy has it all - youth, talent, money. With just two of those three, you can wed any Kardashian. This union is a result of McIlroy's second engagement, and, frankly, he does not appear to grasp the difference between being engaged and being married. Being engaged is a commitment. Being married is a life sentence. You can easily get out of a commitment - heck, that's exactly what he did with tennis star Caroline Wozniacki - but to get out of a marriage, you have to be committed to losing a lot of time and money. Curiously, McIlroy does not recall the resultant good fortune of his collapsed relationship with Wozniacki in 2014. When he broke off that engagement after the wedding invitations were mailed out - incidentally, this is the nuptial equivalent of calling off an office visit to a doctor less than 24 hours before the appointment; Wozniacki should have charged him a cancellation fee - he then went out and won the European PGA Championship the following weekend, then two straight majors. Just a coincidence? I think not. Clearly, cold feet led to a hot putter. He played so well because he felt relaxed and freed from his upcoming till-death-do-us-part ceremony. How could he forget this exultant feeling of liberation? When you're single, you can mingle; when you're married, you are harried. In McIlroy's defense, this is the second time this year his closest confidantes have failed him - first they let Rory walk 18 holes with Donald Trump. Now they have let him walk down the aisle. Also in McIlroy's defense, if he had researched the careers of Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods - the two best in the game in the past 50 years - he would have gotten conflicting signals on the impact of matrimony on golf. Nicklaus married his wife, Barbara, in 1960, then, between 1962 and 1986, won all 18 of his major championships. Marital bliss, professional success. But Woods is a chillingly different story. Before he was married, he won eight majors in a six-year span. While married to Elin Nordegren between 2004 and 2010, he won six more majors. Since the divorce, he has not won any. McIlroy, who turns 28 next month, already has four major titles. But I see a lot more of Tiger in him than Jack; his eye might wander. And here's the problem - there is lots of temptation on the golf tour, and there are Perkins Restaurants everywhere. So, yeah, if I were Erica Stoll, I would be darn worried. By the way, am I the only one who has a problem with her? Stoll famously saved McIlroy from missing his tee time on the final day of the 2012 Ryder Cup when she was working for the PGA of America; he ended up winning his crucial match and helped Europe take the Cup. Uh, but she was working for the PGA of America - why do we celebrate the fact that she committed treason in aiding and abetting the enemy? Anyhow, McIlroy apparently loves her and apparently thinks he's doing the right thing. He also thinks he will be refreshed and recharged by taking a couple weeks off after the wedding before heading to the Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass. But trust me, folks - he's more likely to miss the cut than win the championship. The honeymoon is over, pal. Ask The Slouch Q: Is there any doubt that Serena Williams is America's greatest athlete? Turns out she won the Australian Open in January when she was nearly two months pregnant! (Lisa Martinez; Seguin, Tex.) A: Serena has so much will and skill, she could be in labor and still win in straight sets. Q: Pitcher Madison Bumgarner got injured in a dirt-bike accident - wouldn't his Giants contract prohibit that type of activity? (Anthony Lane; Spokane, Wash.) A: All I know is that my ESPN poker contract doesn't even allow me to walk on a dirt path, much less ride a dirt bike. Q: Are you going to retire at the top of your game or wander slowly into the sunset like so many pro athletes? (Jim Edmondson; McLean) A: I already tried wandering slowly into the sunset, but, idiot that I am, I was walking east. Q: I'm told the last player selected in the NFL draft is known as Mr. Irrelevant. Shouldn't that title be reserved for the Browns' director of postseason ticket sales?

            "body": "(ESPN) Nearly 20 years ago, ESPN researcher Mark Simon brought a suggestion to Phil Orlins, who was then producing \"Sunday Night Baseball.\" Simon thought the network's baseball broadcasts could benefit by including some element of win-probability research, showing viewers how key events changed each team's chances of winning the game. \"You know, that might be good for the website,\" Orlins remembers telling Simon, \"but I don't think it belongs on TV.\" Orlins is now the senior coordinator producer for all of ESPN's baseball telecasts, and it was he who decided this past offseason that it was time to implement that very idea he had once rejected. Orlins predicted win probability stats would prompt a mixed reaction from fans, and he was immediately proved correct on the first day of the baseball season, when many fans registered various levels of objection to the concept. Producers had originally intended to show the win probability stat - based on similar situations in 41,000 completed games - something like once per half-inning. They soon dialed it back, deciding it was less valuable in early-inning situations, or when the game was tied. But Orlins still likes the concept, and still likes using it fairly aggressive in later innings, or when dramatic events cause the numbers to swing. With the Nats set to make their \"Sunday Night Baseball\" season debut against the Mets, I chatted with Orlins about why he likes the concept, why he doesn't mind the strong reaction it's prompted, and the future of analytics in sports broadcasts. Our conversation has been slightly edited for space and clarity. Obviously, it's gotten some attention, so I guess the first question would be how and why did you decide to add the win probability to the screen? For starters, as long as long as we believe in the content and the content having merit, we're more than comfortable with the attention. When change comes along, I always expect it to have more than its fair share of doubters and negativity. That always comes with change. As I've said many times, you want people to like what you're doing, but if they don't like what you're doing, you still want people to be aware and passionate about it. I fear indifference more than I fear a mix of positive and negative responses. What we want to avoid is indifference. Clearly, this is a telecast that people did react to, which I view as good. As far as the why we did it, it's something that we've talked about and used on our digital sites on and off for, gosh, 16 or 17 years. (Note: I'm sure those who are negative on it will say that's where it belongs.) I've always been a little bit fascinated by it, and I was intrigued particularly watching Game 7 of the World Series, the swings on the Rajai Davis home run and the various factors in that game. We got our announcers together by coincidence a week before the Super Bowl, and we had a good conversation about it - mostly positive response, some doubters, but a good conversation. And then literally five days later, the Super Bowl happens. And of course it's a totally different sport, so some might say it's irrelevant. But there it is sitting there, with the Patriots hovering at 1 percent win percentage from midway through the third quarter to the last couple minutes of the game. And it was just funny, because all of the sudden, as the game hits overtime, all the same people we were talking to about it, they're all texting each other a graphic of the Super Bowl win probability. I guess you could just sense the interest and obsession with it, and the impact that it had. Again, that was football, but it was the same kind of response. It added a sense of gravity, a sense of weight, a sense of importance to how momentous what took place was, to the things that happened. And I would also say, maybe I'm alone in this, but in my mind I think all sports fans are kind of calculating that in their brain anyway. Yeah, I do understand how sometimes you don't want to see it, and you could find it bothersome, but it's compelling, and to me, fascinating. And yeah, when my team is going to the ninth inning leading by a run, I am curious what the odds are of them winning. And when the guy walks the leadoff hitter, what's already going through my mind is, 'What are the chances he's going to give up a run?' I just think that's the way people watch games. And seeing a tangible corollary to that is compelling. Maybe a little irritating, but definitely compelling. And I think that's the response we've seen. (ESPN) I don't know that I have an opinion one way or the other. I'm pretty sure I don't, because I don't have opinions about anything. But I guess the counter would be, if you talk about the gravity and the momentousness of comebacks, and calculating it in your head and all that, people would ask, is anyone doing that or does anyone care about that when it's 1-1 in the third, right? Well, we're not really using it when it's 1-1 in the third, although we might have the first day or two of the season, if truth be told. If it's nothing-nothing going into the bottom of the seventh, you start to see some swings, because now your home team's got three more shots and your visiting team's only got two. But I do think it's sort of so obvious that a tie game is roughly up for grabs that we don't really push it until scoring starts. We start using it as scoring starts to develop and change in the early parts of the game, and then we tend to use it fairly aggressively as we get into the late innings and the kind of situations I was describing. Maybe I'm a little loony in this, but I'm watching a Met game - that wasn't even on ESPN - and I called up my win probability chart. When I talk about the gravity of it, this is what I mean. Jerry Blevins came in and got two outs as a lefty specialist out of the bullpen. Now he actually came in in a situation where the Mets had an 18 percent chance of winning the game, and left in a situation where they had a 66 percent chance of winning the game. He came in with the bases loaded and one out in the top of the ninth inning, gets a strikeout and a groundout to get out of it, and they go to the bottom of the ninth moving to a 66 percent chance. A lefty specialist who's getting paid a few million dollars comes in and gets two outs, and the next day in the box score it's going to say two-thirds of an inning, but actually in that moment, he had close to a 50 percent effect on the likely outcome of that game. Hey ESPN, I guess I'm OK with you showing a win probability graphic late in a ballgame. But in the second inning, when it's scoreless? Nah. - Dan Kolko (@masnKolko) April 3, 2017 Yeah. I'm not a math guy, and I know that it's done based on the historical likelihood of these things happening. But I think some people might say, is there a problem with the system if Jerry Blevins can record two outs and flip the odds so dramatically? Were those two outs from Jerry Blevins really worth a 50 percent swing in who's going to win the game? I'm sure the math backs it up. Again, a million things could have happened to not give him that opportunity up to that point. [Yoenis] Cespedes could have hit two home runs, they could have been five runs ahead, but they weren't. That's not to say that Jerry Blevins is going to be in that spot very often, and it's not to say that he's necessarily 50 percent responsible for the outcome of the game, but it is [a] fact that over literally 41,000 games, that when you're in a tie game in the top of the ninth and the other team has the based loaded and one out, your chances of winning are not good in that situation. And there's logic to that. But I love that thought process you're going through. And again, I get that a lot of people are like, 'Hey, I just want to watch the game, leave me alone.' That could be the response. But I'll take your response - 'I've got to think about that, that doesn't quite make sense to me.' That's caring, and noticing. Thank the Lord we have the ESPN Win Probability stat to tell us the team that's ahead has a good chance to win. - Christian Schneider (@Schneider_CM) April 17, 2017 Was there one thing that made you think this was the year to do it, or this was the time to do it? I think if anything I just found myself fascinated by it during Game 7 of the World Series. Other times, too. I don't know if you ever play around on Baseball Reference during an individual game, but there's a win probability graph. You literally just move your cursor along that graph and it will pop up and tell you what play happened. I started to get a little into that experience. A guy gets a big hit - say they're down by two runs in the ninth with two outs, how much did the walk before the home run change the win probability? Things like that I find intriguing. Some of the reaction is kind of humorous. It's a tiny little graphic that goes above the score. It's the tiniest little thing. I do laugh a little bit when people are like, 'Oh my God, they're forcing it on me.' You know, it's taking up about one two-hundredth of the screen. ESPN showing win probability is extremely good. Next up, run expectancy! - Neil Weinberg (@NeilWeinberg44) April 4, 2017 I was going to ask you, though, do you have ideas of what might be the next way that analytics are going to impact broadcasts? Because obviously we've also seen the Statcast stuff, with exit velocity and launch angle and all of that. Where do you think we're going with this? Well, linear TV is an interesting, fascinating challenge because we don't get to offer people alternatives. We're single stream, so to speak, so we have to find the right way to be aggressive, to be progressive with our thinking and be aware that we have a full group of viewers out there. I really think win probability is a minor controversy compared to the live strike zone that we started a couple years earlier. We do want to be fairly aggressive with that type of data, at least be aware and use it as appropriate. It was a big deal 20 years ago to put pitch speed in every pitch of a baseball game. So I guess what I'm speculating on, is there a time that we're going to be putting up hit speed as well, or something of that nature? I'm not really sure. I'm wondering if one day, every action that happens on a field, immediately numbers will pop up by it.  It's possible. It's possible. In a certain sense, leaving something else less noticeable, in a way. The constant score, count, people go find it when they want to find it, whereas something that comes in and out - like we're doing with win probability now - in some ways even though it's not there all the time, it may feel a little more impactful. So do I think about the possibility of a very subtle sliding [graphic] at the bottom that kind of moves across the screen? It's crossed my mind. How old are you, can I ask? I'm 52. In my head, it would have been someone very young who came up with the idea of doing it. I don't know if you qualify or not. I'll tell you it is interesting. The live K-zone thing, when I talk to 10-year-olds, 12-year-olds, 14-year-olds about it, people don't even know what I'm asking. Do you like that, does that bother you? They're like, 'What are you talking about? It's fine.' It's just interesting what you get from a 10-year-old, a young person who truly is video-game immersed. And again, other viewers and older viewers, they may hate me for that. Whatever. It's fine. But anyway, the age thing is interesting. I don't know. Maybe I thought old when I was young and think young when I'm old. I will tell you this: I think I have more perspective about the variety of responses we get from people, about the importance of people differentiating our product. Twenty, 25 years ago, when I saw the purple puck on Fox, I thought it was the worst thing in the world. And now I look back at it and go, you know what, maybe they had a pretty good idea about how they were trying to position their image. That's a different perspective than I would have had at 32. Do you think, then, that 10 years from now this will look impossibly simplistic? That every broadcast would have elements of this somehow? Ten years from now? I think it's likely that broadcasts will continue to get more aggressive with how they use information, and you'll be watching on larger screens that will have more space for it, or you'll be watching on a handheld device, in which case you'll probably have options. You're streaming it on your phone or your glasses or whatever it might be in 10 years, and you'll probably be able to sort of choose what presentation you want around the video - graphic intensive or stat intensive or highlights of other games or other sports scores going by. But I do think the large-screen presentation will probably continue to migrate. Things change so much. Yeah, I think it will continue to get more aggressive over time. It's definitely an interesting debate. The interesting debate is a win in and of itself. That's what we're here for. That's exactly what I was saying. Plenty of people aren't going to like it. That's fine. Let's get some passion, get some emotion. That's all good.",

            "body": "Vivid drama, expressive phrasing and spontaneity make a musical performance distinctive. Steven Isserlis displayed all these qualities in his recital Friday at the Library of Congress. The British cellist did so with a program that shunned repertorial favorites for an eclectic range of pieces drawn entirely from the 20th century. Isserlis plays on gut strings, not for reasons of historical authenticity but for their special sound, and the Coolidge Auditorium is the ideal setting to hear them. In Shostakovich's D minor cello sonata, Isserlis gave a soft sheen to the cantabile parts of the first movement, and an intense serenity to the slow movement. When the action got louder, as in the brutal comedy of the second movement and the Haydn-like danse fun\u00e8bre of the finale, Canadian pianist Connie Shih, who was often too reticent, had to provide the lion's share of the volume. Bohuslav Martin\u016f's first cello sonata, also in D minor, felt like a twin for the Shostakovich piece, driven to a fast and furious ending in the parallel major. \"Lieux retrouv\u00e9s\" was the most recent work of the evening, composed for Isserlis by Thomas Ad\u00e8s in 2009. It is, as Isserlis described it from the stage, an attempt to realize Proust-like descriptions of place in music. The performers captured especially the range of watery sounds in the first movement and the placid sense of pastoral stasis in the third. Other composers on the second half, Isserlis explained, were selected because they were favorites of Ad\u00e8s. The gut strings again paid dividends in Reynaldo Hahn's \"Deux improvisations sur des airs irlandais,\" sugary encore bonbons that were simply gorgeous, and the encore, an arrangement of Chopin's Polish song \"Nie ma czego trzeba\" (sometimes known in English as \"Faded and Vanished\"). In that regard, the slow movement was the highlight of an otherwise rather busy second cello sonata by Faur\u00e9.",

            "body": "During a small working lunch at the White House last month, the question of job security in President Trump's tumultuous White House came up, and one of the attendees wondered whether press secretary Sean Spicer might be the first to go. The president's response was swift and unequivocal. \"I'm not firing Sean Spicer,\" he said, according to someone familiar with the encounter. \"That guy gets great ratings. Everyone tunes in.\"  Trump even likened Spicer's daily news briefings to a daytime soap opera, noting proudly that his press secretary attracted nearly as many viewers.   For Trump - a reality TV star who parlayed his blustery-yet-knowing on-air persona into a winning political brand - television is often the guiding force of his day, both weapon and scalpel, megaphone and news feed. And the president's obsession with the tube - as a governing tool, a metric for staff evaluation, and a two-way conduit with lawmakers and aides - has upended the traditional rhythms of the White House, influencing many spheres, including policy, his burgeoning relationship with Congress, and whether he taps out a late-night or early-morning tweet.  Those Trump tweet-storms, which contain some of his most controversial utterances, are usually prompted by something he has seen on television just moments before. The president, advisers said, also uses details gleaned from cable news as a starting point for policy discussions or a request for more information, and appears on TV himself when he wants to appeal directly to the public.  White House press secretary Sean Spicer speaks during an interview outside the West Wing. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Some White House officials - who early on would appear on TV to emphasize points to their boss, who was likely to be watching just steps away in his residence - have started tuning into Fox News' \"Fox & Friends\" because they know the president habitually clicks it on after waking near dawn.  But Trump's habits have consequences far beyond being the quirky, unchanging ways of a 70-year-old man who keeps an eye on cable as he goes about his day, as his confidants describe his behavior. Foreign diplomats have urged their governments' leaders to appear on television when they're stateside as a means of making their case to Trump, and U.S. lawmakers regard a TV appearance as nearly on par with an Oval Office meeting in terms of showcasing their standing or viewpoints to the president.  Former House speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said Trump's intense monitoring cuts both ways. \"At times, it'll lead to mistakes,\" he said. \"Other times, it lets him move with astounding speed.\" \"It's all part of him being this work in progress who is constantly listening and evolving,\" Gingrich added. Explaining his decision to launch 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian air base, Trump even cited, publicly and privately, the gruesome images of dead and dying Syrian children poisoned with the nerve agent sarin, images that dominated television for several days.  \"President Trump is someone who comes to the White House with a sophisticated understanding of how to communicate, the power of television, the power of imagery, the power of message, and how message, messenger and delivery all work together,\" said Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president.   The president's fascination with television is born of personal experience. Trump, long a fixture in the New York tabloids, did not become a household presence until 2004, when he began hosting NBC's hit reality TV show \"The Apprentice.\" He relished the attention, boasting about and fretting over his ratings, much as he now handles political polls.  White House press secretary Sean Spicer talks with the media in early March. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) He is also a natural showman. During the campaign, he riveted viewers with his raucous rallies, where he often spoke for more than hour without any notes or teleprompters. And in TV interviews, he sometimes offers tips on matters including lighting and chair placement, with an intuitive sense of what makes for good TV. \"He is very attuned to the fact that cable networks have 24 hours a day that they need to fill - and if you're interesting, you are gold,\" Gingrich said. Always tuned in Trump's quotidian viewing is unremarkable, based on his profile. Fox News's average prime-time viewer last year, for instance, was 68 years old and mostly white, and the average American watches more than four hours per day, according to Nielsen data. On his campaign plane, Trump watched television on full volume - usually Fox News, sometimes CNN - almost constantly, said someone who flew with him, shushing his aides whenever he himself came on the screen and listening with rapt attention. When Hillary Clinton appeared, he'd similarly quiet his team, often before pointing a finger at the TV and scolding: \"She's lying! She's lying!\" To relax, however, he would occasionally watch the Golf Channel, while on his plane or in the clubhouses of some of his private courses.  Now that he's in the White House, friends and aides describe a president who still consumes a steady diet of cable news. During an intimate lunch recently with a key outside ally in a small West Wing dining room, for instance, Trump repeatedly paused the conversation to make the group watch a particularly combative Spicer briefing.  Trump turns on the television almost as soon as he wakes, then checks in periodically throughout the day in the small dining room off the Oval Office, and continues late into the evening when he's back in his private residence. \"Once he goes upstairs, there's no managing him,\" said one adviser.  Sometimes, at night, he hate-watches cable shows critical of him, while chatting on the phone with friends, said someone familiar with the president's routine - a quirk a senior official jokingly called \"multi-teching.\"  In the morning, the president typically flips between \"Fox & Friends,\" Maria Bartiromo's show on Fox Business and CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" West Wing aides assert that the president stopped watching MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" after the show's hosts grew increasingly critical of his presidency, but some confidants think he still tunes in, especially for the top of the program. His feelings toward CNN and its president, Jeff Zucker, who greenlighted \"The Apprentice\" when he was running NBC Entertainment, are similarly fraught. Trump is furious with Zucker for what he thinks is the network's unfair coverage but admires Zucker's business bona fides and ratings growth, said a friend.   Most of the televisions in the West Wing display four channels at all times - CNN, Fox, Fox Business and MSNBC.  The president also likes One America News, a conservative-leaning channel whose correspondent often gets questions in Spicer's daily news briefing, and before the campaign told an aide that he occasionally enjoyed watching Al Jazeera.   He is still in touch with Roger Ailes, the former Fox News chairman who was ousted amid charges of sexual harassment and who unofficially advised Trump near the end of the presidential campaign. But, Trump has told friends, he thinks Fox News is \"nicer\" to him in the post-Ailes era. Fox News host Sean Hannity, meanwhile, is especially close to Trump's two older sons, as well as to the president. \"For all the talk about how the media is so tough on Trump, which they are, the most interesting thing about Trump and the media is that in the end, Trump totally manipulated the media,\" said Stephen Moore, an economist for the Heritage Foundation who served as a senior adviser to the Trump campaign. \"The media is why he won - because he completely dominated the media. That's the irony of the whole thing.\"  Appearances matter West Wing staffers have begun including local news clippings in his morning briefing, said one, noting that an issue such as rolling back environmental regulations may earn the president poor press nationally but a more positive headline - \"Trump saves coal jobs,\" for example - in a local paper.  But Trump - who has boasted to several advisers and friends about having \"the world's best TiVo\" - remains most focused on what he sees on his flat screens, going so far as to compliment print reporters on their television appearances.   He can also be critical. When Spicer did his first briefing-room appearance in an ill-fitting gray pinstripe suit, the president made his displeasure known, and Spicer returned the next week more crisply attired. Trump often asks his West Wing staff whether they happened to catch their colleagues' TV hits, praising dramatically confrontational or cool and smooth appearances.    \"He prefers facts and figures; he likes when people are defending but also explaining. He likes toughness but also appreciates polish, poise and positivity,\" Conway said. \"He appreciates when you don't look like people are bothering you or getting the best of you. He loves when you call out media bias, or what the anchors have said or not said.\"  Trump was especially incensed, said a senior adviser, by what he saw as cable news' blanket coverage of his campaign and what was portrayed as his administration's overly cozy ties to Russia.  Another time, Trump took particular issue with the aesthetics of a male commentator who appeared sometimes as a guest on \"Morning Joe,\" and began pestering the hosts, imploring them to dump the analyst who so offended his visual sensibilities, said someone with knowledge of the episode.  But Trump's interest in TV has proved a welcome - and at times surprising - point of entry to the White House for lawmakers and even pundits.   Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) once appealed to Trump directly on \"Morning Joe,\" addressing the camera to implore the president to call him so the two could chat about prescription drugs. A day or so later, Cummings said, the president himself responded.  \"I was a little surprised that he called - I thought his secretary would call, but he actually called,\" Cummings said. \"But it's the way he operates. And he does watch television and he's very critical of television, and I thought we had a good conversation.\"  Gingrich added that sometimes after an appearance on \"Fox & Friends,\" he'll have just left the studio and not even reached his car when his cellphone will ring: the president calling to tell him, \"That was good.\"  Indeed, it is now a running joke in television green rooms that if a trade association or special-interest group wants to reach the president, the smartest use of their money is to buy morning television ad time or book a representative on air.  House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), a friend of the president's, said he has been impressed with how Trump will call attention to individual lawmakers in meetings, recalling who said what about him or his policies on TV.  \"I've watched him in rooms where he goes through person by person. He clearly keeps track,\" McCarthy said. \"He's not just watching big shows, either. He has called us up after watching our news conferences here at the Capitol.\"  Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.), a nattily dressed 39-year-old former Air Force pilot who now serves in the Air National Guard, was taken aback when Trump singled him out during an Oval Office meeting with several House Republicans during health-care discussions, telling the group to pay attention to how sharply attired and articulate Kinzinger is on TV.  \"We all come into the Oval, and right when he sees me, he goes, 'You're really good on TV,' \" Kinzinger said, confirming the anecdote with a chuckle. \"Then, during our meeting, he eventually gets to me, and that's when he tells the whole group. It was fun to hear.\"   Not everyone appreciates Trump's television obsession. Some of his tweets, often prompted by TV segments, have left his aides scrambling to reverse-engineer information to support his dubious assertions. Others worry about a president who can seem to be swayed by the last thing he sees on TV, a medium geared more for entertainment than actual policymaking.   Rick Wilson, a veteran Republican consultant and vocal Trump critic, said a number of Republicans in Congress and in establishment party circles find the president's habits bizarre to the point of alarming, although they rarely say so publicly because they do not want to draw his wrath.  \"There are many conversations where it ends: 'But of course, God knows, he could watch Fox News tomorrow and change his whole position,' \" Wilson said. \"They don't get him, because he's a creature of television and they're creatures of politics. They care about the details, he cares about what's on TV.\" The president, Wilson added, \"is a TV character to them, and they have to navigate around it.\" Either way, Trump's viewing habits have seeped into the ether of both the White House and the nation's capital. During the Republicans' failed health-care push last month, Trump invited a small group of conservative activists to meet with him in the Oval Office.  When the meeting was over, said someone with knowledge of the gathering, the president made a plea to the participants: \"I know you have already said it's a bad deal, but Kellyanne is going to walk you out to the microphones and I'd love it if you could say it's great,\" Trump said. The group never did embrace the health-care proposal. But speaking briefly to reporters that evening, the attendees were polite and took pains not to criticize Trump himself.  And later, as they began doing television appearances to gin up opposition to the bill, they were always careful to mention that they appreciated the open dialogue with the president and his inviting them into the West Wing to chat.  After all, they knew he'd be watching.  Dan Balz contributed to this report.",

However, it has become evident that his equally uninformed supporters view those characteristics as virtues, rather than flaws.

All new what leaderships was about - the kind of steady, quiet, resolute ability to motivate people to perform difficult tasks under pressure without giving a fig about the news media.\n\nWe have come this far: instead of governing with solid decision-making President Trump is consumed with any and all depictions of him in the media.

Even when Nixon committed illegal acts in office and the Washington Post pursued an investigation into the Watergate break-in, all of the media coverage did not unseat Nixon. He tried to tough it out. Ultimately, a bipartisan congressional investigation with witnesses subpoened from Nixon's White House staff and others, had to answer questions about Nixon's actions. And the tapes that he had made of his conversations that were revealed by John Dean to Congress added to the pressure to vote for impeachment. The media did not discover the tapes that damned Nixon.\n\nPolling can only take readers so far. It is subject to error. The Clinton campaign relied too much on polling to guide its campaign and made fatal mistakes. Frankly, Trump also focuses too intently on polls, though he scoffs at them.

            "body": "President Trump delivers his first address to a joint session of Congress from the floor of the House of Representatives in Washington on Feb. 28, 2017. (European Pressphoto Agency/JIM LO SCALZO) On Tuesday, President Trump, like others before him, will deliver the keynote address at a ceremony commemorating the Holocaust. A president's participation in the Days of Remembrance ceremony, hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, is not new; every president since the museum opened in 1993 has done so. But unlike his predecessors, Trump - as a candidate and as president - has been widely criticized by Jewish organizations for what they see as a lackluster and slow response to the recent spike in anti-Semitic incidents across the country. His young administration also has been faulted for a couple of recent flubs about the Holocaust. This means that the speech Trump will deliver during the week-long commemoration of the Holocaust could be a critical step for him to appease some of his critics. Just a few months ago, on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, the president was criticized for a statement that failed to mention Jews and instead used a more general phrase, \"innocent people.\" [Spicer: Hitler 'didn't even sink to using chemical weapons,' although he sent Jews to 'the Holocaust center'] \"It is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember and honor the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust,\" the statement said. \"It is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror.\" Afterward, Steven Goldstein, executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect and a frequent Trump critic, blasted the president: \"How can you forget, Mr. President, that 6 million Jews were murdered because they were Jews? You chose the vague phrase, 'innocent people.' They were Jews, Mr. President.\" And this month, White House press secretary Sean Spicer found himself apologizing profusely for another Holocaust blunder. In trying to condemn Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons, Spicer falsely said that Adolf Hitler \"didn't even sink to using chemical weapons.\" Hitler gassed millions of Jews. As the comment gained traction on social media, a reporter asked Spicer for clarification, but he only dug himself into a deeper hole. He said Hitler did not use sarin gas \"on his own people the same way that Assad was doing.\" [What the Anne Frank Center thinks of Sean Spicer's apology: Too little, too late] Spicer apologized hours later, calling his statement \"inappropriate and insensitive.\" He apologized again during a forum at the Newseum the next day, acknowledging that his gaffe was compounded by the fact that it occurred on the second day of Passover, the most celebrated of all Jewish holidays in the United States. \"I let the president down ... This was mine to own, mine to apologize for. Mine to ask forgiveness for,\" Spicer said. Spicer's gaffe and his subsequent apologies rocketed around the Internet, even inspiring another satirical Spicer skit on Saturday Night Live. It also prompted a statement from Goldstein, who called on Trump to fire his press secretary. He described Spicer's remarks as \"the most offensive form of fake news imaginable.\" Goldstein also didn't appear moved by Spicer's multiple apologies, calling them \"a bureaucratic response to an outcry.\" The week-long Days of Remembrance began Sunday. During Tuesday's ceremony at the Capitol Rotunda, a Holocaust survivor accompanied by a member of Congress will light six candles in memory of the victims, according to a news release from the museum. The annual observance will open with a procession of flags from each of the U.S. Army liberating divisions to commemorate the American troops who liberated the Nazi concentration camps.

Ethan Roser, a 19-year-old freshman from the Cincinnati area, was volunteering at the Wheaton, Ill., meet when he was struck at about 4:15 p.m. Central time. Wheaton College Public Safety and paramedics were on the scene, the Chicago Tribune reported, and Roser was pronounced dead at Advocate Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove. An autopsy is planned for Monday. Roser, who had transferred to the school in January, is the son of Christian missionaries and spent his early years in Africa. \"We know he's with Jesus,\" his father, the Rev. Mark Roser, told the Tribune, \"and the fact that he's in paradise is a great source of comfort to us.\" His father recalled how his son worried when the family was moving from Zimbabwe to the United States. \"I said, 'It's the people that make the place,' \" his father said, \"and he looked at me and said, 'But the place stays in your heart forever.' \" College student killed by hammer at track and field event #EthanRoser #WheatonCollege https://t.co/szZlV4FKcV pic.twitter.com/gj6mHBIctm - Follow News (@follownews_com) April 23, 2017 Roser's brother, Johnathan, wrote Saturday on Facebook: This afternoon, my youngest brother Ethan, who was just 19 years old, was called home to be with our Lord. We are in shock and struggling to comprehend how we will live without him. Ethan lived a powerful life, he was studying at Wheaton, in preparation to be a minister. Ethan would want you to know that although we face many setbacks and struggles in life, that there is great victory and triumphant glory in knowing and following Jesus. Death never has the final word because Jesus overcame death and has prepared a place for us in heaven with the great ones. Although we sow in tears we will reap in joy when we see him again in paradise. We love you all very much and we're truly grateful for your prayers and encouragement. We will keep you updated on his memorial celebration service. Details of the accident weren't readily available. Typically, the hammer, which weighs as much as 16 pounds, is a metal ball attached to a steel wire and an athlete spins several times before releasing it. Wheaton College is a Christian, liberal-arts school located about 20 miles west of Chicago.",

            "body": "(Jia Naqvi/The Washington Post) Just hours after the Washington March for Science dispersed, organizers sent an email to demonstrators with the subject line, \"What's next?\" \"Our movement is just starting,\" the message read. It went on to urge marchers to take part in a \"week of action,\" a set of coordinated activities that range from signing an environmental voting pledge to participating in a citizen science project. They will provide postcards for participants to send to their political leaders and a calendar of events recommended by the march's partner groups. The march website was also overhauled Saturday night to include a new page on the organization's vision for the future. The details are not fully fleshed out (and the page still included a few typos Sunday afternoon), but organizers say they aim to build a new science advocacy network and establish programs to better engage the public with science. \"We intend to symbolically keep marching,\" said national co-chair Valerie Aquino. \"I would love for the March for Science to continue growing into a global movement.\" That goal will require a sea change in how scientists think about outreach. But after the success of the march, which turned out tens of thousands of demonstrators in more than 600 cities, organizers think it could happen. [As scientists erupt in protest, a volcanologist runs for Congress] This public engagement is unprecedented for the scientific community. Rush Holt, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, noted before the march that his colleagues tend to be wary about advocacy. Some worry that such efforts might make their research appear less objective; many simply haven't seen it as their job to make sure their work is available and understood outside of academic circles. But in the wake of President Trump's election, and in the face of policy changes and proposed budget cuts that threatened several areas of research, the community is galvanized. \"The level of anxiety about the state of science, its place in our society and government, and whether the conditions under which science can thrive are being maintained and defended ... anxiety about that has led people to go into the public square,\" Holt told reporters. [Why people are marching for science: 'There is no Planet B'] Organizers insisted that the March for Science was political, but not partisan. Their stated goal was not to condemn the Trump administration - though there were plenty of jabs at the president during the day's events - but to emphasize the importance of science in society. Aquino, an anthropologist who has had projects canceled because of a lack of public funding, said scientists don't always take responsibility for making the case for their work. But she thinks the march might signal a change in that perspective. \"I really hope that there is a fundamental shift in the zeitgeist of the scientific community from 'my job is done when I produce the data and I'm going to leave it at someone else's doorstep,' to 'Science isn't finished until you communicate it, and not just in a journal that most people don't have access to,'\" she said. Brenda Ekwurzel, the director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said that she's been trying to convey this message for years. Working in climate research, it was clear to her that scientists needed to be better at outreach if they were ever going to convince the public to take steps against climate change, she said - that's why she left academia for advocacy in 2005. But most of her colleagues didn't follow suit; \"They thought the data would speak for itself.\" On Saturday, taking in the thousands of sodden marchers chanting \"Ho ho, hey hey, I support the EPA,\" Ekwurzel said \"I cannot believe I am surrounded by so many scientists.\" \"I'm surprised at how energized they are. That means to me they really see there's a threat.\" Fellow marcher Aileen Frayna, who works for a genetic diagnostics company in Germantown, Md., showed up dressed in a Ms. Frizzle costume she made herself. She couldn't remember the last time she'd been to a protest, let alone one this big. \"I was previously very passive,\" Frayna said. She would sometimes fail to vote in local elections; she hasn't been involved in science outreach efforts. But events since the election have been \"a smack in the face.\" The geneticist is now looking into political groups like 314 Action, which aims to get more scientists elected to public office. Frayna doesn't think she's cut out for a political career, but she said she might try to volunteer. She's also interested in efforts to increase representation of women and minorities in STEM; as a Filipina woman, she feels it's especially important to represent her community. \"After November, I know I need to participate in things like this,\" Frayna said. \"I can't just sit idly by.\" Read more: Here are some of the best signs from the March for Science in Washington and around the world The March for Science began with this person's 'throwaway line' on Reddit The March for Science could break stubborn stereotypes about scientists",

            "body": "Dennis Schroder drives past Bradley Beal in the first quarter of Game 3. (Daniel Shirey/Getty Images) ATLANTA - John Wall said he saw it coming. Before the Washington Wizards faced the Atlanta Hawks in Game 3 on Saturday, Wall said he imagined how Atlanta would come out with hair-on-fire intensity. The Hawks would make the shots they missed in the earlier two losses of the series while fans inside Philips Arena would test the limits of their vocal cords. And Wall had a message for his teammates. \"I said, 'We have to withstand their first five minutes,' \" Wall recalled a day later. Although Wall was spot on with his prediction, his warning didn't matter as the Wizards played the first quarter at half speed, allowing 38 points and setting the tone for the rest of a game in which they trailed and chased but never caught up in a 116-98 defeat. [Wizards-Hawks: Game 4 preview and all the latest on the series] \"We watched the film, the first six minutes we weren't even in the same intensity,\" Wall said following the team's Sunday workout and video session inside the Georgia Tech basketball practice facility. \"We basically just gave those guys warmup shots.\" The Wizards still hold a 2-1 lead, but ahead of Game 4, Wall isn't the only player issuing warnings. To leave Atlanta with a stranglehold on this round, up 3-1 as opposed to a 2-2 tie, Washington must heighten its sense of urgency, especially at the start of the game. \"It's very important. This next game is going to be the game that's going to control the series,\" Wizards forward Otto Porter Jr. said. \"Our mind-set going into this game is like we were at home. \"We've got to take care of business.\" In other words, play like Atlanta did in Game 3. \"They've got a smell of a win, so they're confident now,\" Wizards guard Bradley Beal said. \"It's important for us to bring that confidence back down and let them know we're here, we're the better team, and we're going to fight and prove it.\" After falling behind 2-0 in the series, the Hawks naturally enjoyed a boost from returning to Atlanta. Even so, the Wizards did little to disrupt this home comfort. In that first quarter, the Hawks scored the second-most points in an opening period in franchise playoff history. Dennis Schroder, who has improved from the perimeter but remains a penetrating point guard, confidently made a pair of three-pointers in that opening quarter. Schroder had a monster start, scoring 15 points in the first and finishing with 27. Rookie forward Taurean Prince, another beneficiary of open looks beyond the arc, scored 16 points in the game - the combined total of Porter and Markieff Morris. Following the loss, Washington Coach Scott Brooks didn't feel as if his team came out relaxed. By Sunday, however, Beal had reviewed the start, and he had a different explanation. \"I might go opposite. I think we might have been a little too lax. Maybe a little too cool,\" Beal said. \"We didn't make a lot of shots, but we weren't really defending well either. [We were] kind of like thinking they were going to give us the game a little bit, and they came out, they were more physical. They were the aggressors from the get-go on both ends of the floor.\" Overall, the Hawks simply played better - a point on which Wall had no problem crediting his opponent. Wall praised Atlanta Coach Mike Budenholzer and name dropped Schroder, Prince and Paul Millsap for their performances. However, his compliments only lasted so long before he turned his focus to his team. \"We know what we have to do to cut their water off,\" Wall said. \"We don't want to give them the opportunity to make it 2-2, even though we're going back home after this,\" Wall said. \"We don't want to have to come back here again. We're trying to win Game 4, take one game at a time and close it out at home.\" More Wizards: Brewer: Wall has been a one-man highlight reel - and that's the problem After Game 3, Markieff Morris calls out the Hawks' Paul Millsap: 'He's a crybaby' Game 3 best/worst | Series guide: Schedule and everything else to know More Wizards | NBA news | Post Sports | Post Sports on Facebook",

                "I have been worried about this series from the start.\n  \nNot because I want to create negative vibes...but more because\n1)  I don't like when my favorite teams go from \"virtually zero love\" to \"Eastern Conference Finals lock\" in a span of days.  That always makes me nervous.  They don't have the deep playoff experience to completely block that out.  Result, Hawks played harder in game 3 than the Wiz....noticeably.  \n \n2) Sometimes certain players of only modest credentials in the league have various teams or matchups that they thrive in.  It is very hard to explain.  And does not apply to the very best players in the league...because they are the BEST...\nBut the reason why this series made me nervous is because by my eyeballs (not going to take the time to confirm it)...but by my eyeballs, if you take the guys from the Hawks series we lost 2 years ago...and compare it to the current players...the guys the Hawks lost, were guys who didn't play well against the Wiz.  And the guys they Kept or added...have tended to play very well against the Wiz.  \nFor example...Schroder over performs against the Wiz... Teague usually underperforms against the Wiz...Millsap usually plays better against the Wiz than Horford does.  Korver tends to not be hot against the Wiz....Ersan Ilyasova tends to play very well against the Wiz.  And so on, so forth. \nSo yes, I'm nervous.  I'd feel MUCH better if Mahinmi came back.  I think that would have a big impact on what Schroder is doing to the Wiz.  \nI also do not like how they are guarding Schroder on the pick-and-roll.  They seem to be switching WAY TOO FRIVOLANTLY.   Schroder cannot hit midrange jumpers off the dribble.  So either go underneath and don't switch.  Or switch, and the big man needs to give major room to force him to take that midrange jumper.  The Wiz should know that, because for about 4-5 years, that was the exact formula which was most effective against John Wall.", 
                "I'd like to see an article about what the Wizards \"do\" rather than what they \"say.\" Morris, for example, stopped \"doing\" anything after game one. Since then all he has done is talk.  Rather than give out quotes, I'd like to see Beal actually stay between his man and the rim on a few defensive possessions.", 
                "so far this series, one of our guards is earning his check", 
                "No kidding....and what's more, a lot of Schroder's dominance has come because Brooks has chosen to have Beal guard Schroder for a good chunk of the possessions in this series.  \nThat said, Beal has shown major improvement this year (AFTER the big contract)...so I don't think he has rested on his laurels.  I think he will get it together.   \nWall has been amazing.  I'm happy for him.  Colin Cowherd doesn't even nit-pick on him anymore (FINALLY!!!).", 
                "Beal Shouldn't say #%$@ ...  don't say \"WE\" Just say \"I\" cause he plays like SH&amp;**... \"First Let me give thanks to my Lord &amp; Savior\"...  can you show him that you appreciate the gifts that he's Blessed You With!!  Practice !!!  Warm Up!!! Put Some FREAKIN EFFORT OUT...  You signed a Big Contract only to Watch Wall Carry the Whole Load!!!  GEEEEZ!!!!! WIZ !!!!!", 
                "now mostly I have been a great supporter of Beal since he came to DC however we need him and Porter to get in attack the rim mode not shooting enough free throws vs the hawks must attack the rim has little to do with takeing them lightly just not agressive   fix that and they come back 3-1 up otherwise its 2-2 and the series its best 2 out of 3"

            "body": "It sounds like a gang of baddies from a comic book or a Hardy Boys adventure. But the Black Hand was dead serious, a loose network of Italian immigrants who in the early 20th century terrorized dozens of American cities and towns by demanding protection money from merchants, kidnapping children (the ransom note typically came embellished with the logo of a black hand), and committing murders - all with near-impunity because the cowed victims refused to testify. In \"The Black Hand,\" his gripping account of this scourge, Stephan Talty focuses on Joseph Petrosino, who did more than anyone else to cripple the Hand. His task was made even more difficult by the failure of his employer, the New York Police Department, to give him the manpower he needed. Italian Americans were looked down upon as \"dagos\" or \"wops\" (short for \"without papers,\" Talty says), and as long as the Hand kept to Little Italy, the political establishment hardly stirred itself. At the time, the NYPD employed mostly Irish Americans, none of whom spoke Italian or had much interest in cooperating with Petrosino. \"The Black Hand: The Epic War Between a Brilliant Detective and the Deadliest Secret Society in American History,\" by Stephan Talty (HMH) The Petrosinos had immigrated in 1873, when Joseph was 13. To help support his family, he left school after sixth grade to work full time as a shoeshine boy, earning about a quarter a day. At age 17 or 18, he was hired as a city street cleaner. Thanks to his work ethic, his obvious talent and the intercession of a mentor, he advanced to commander of a scow that dumped municipal garbage in the Atlantic Ocean. In 1883, despite being only 5 feet 3 inches tall, he was recruited by the police force of what already qualified as \"the largest Italian city in the world.\" [The last days of the New York mob] One of Petrosino's motives in going after the Black Hand was a fear that authorities might eventually crack down on immigration from Italy. Yet he also sought to distance himself from his countrymen. In an almost unheard-of break with Old World tradition, Petrosino remained single and lived alone in a non-Italian part of town. (He finally married at age 47.) His superb memory for faces and his dogged pursuit of leads won him a promotion to detective, leadership of a small unit of Italian cops, and the nickname \"the Italian Sherlock Holmes.\" One of his star turns came when the Hand tried to extort $5,000 from the great Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. Impersonating Caruso, Petrosino kept the rendezvous and overpowered and arrested the extortionists. (One wonders if they could have blown \"Caruso's\" cover by demanding a song.) Despite his success, however, Petrosino faced discrimination within the NYPD just as his countrymen did outside it, and his operation remained woefully understaffed as the Black Hand expanded into other cities and states. All that changed, however, when a man without ties to the political machine known as Tammany Hall was appointed commissioner of police. This was Theodore Bingham, an ex-military engineer who may have sucked even more oxygen out of rooms than a dynamic predecessor in the police commissioner's job, Theodore Roosevelt. At the heart of \"The Black Hand\" is Talty's account of how Bingham was both the best and worst of bosses, making a favorite of Petrosino, giving him the support he needed, but foolishly sending him on an intelligence-gathering trip to Italy, where, thanks to Petrosino, so many Black Hand members were now living in sullen exile. ['Every Night I Dream of Hell' takes us deep inside a hit man's life] The author Stephan Talty (Natacha Vilceus/Natacha Vilceus) Talty, himself the son of Irish immigrants, tells his story with flair. In addition to Caruso's cameo, there is one by the young Al Capone, a Hand member who fled New York when things got too hot there and ended up at \"the site of his future empire\" - Chicago. Talty also gives us a peek at the leave-nothing-to-chance ethos of Tammany Hall. \"It was said that [boss Big Tim Sullivan] perfumed the ballots on election day so that he could make sure his constituents had actually voted by sniffing out the scent on their hands.\" And the Black Hand knew it had arrived when, in 1905, a newspaper serial featuring the famous lawman Bat Masterson kicked off with him \"On the Trail of the Black Hand.\" I only wish the author had provided more detail on how the Black Hand was finally stopped. Once Petrosino is out of the picture, Talty seems to lose interest, covering the gang's decline and fall in a mere three-and-a-half pages. On the whole, though, this is a valuable recounting of a lurid and little-known episode in American history. Dennis Drabelle is a former mysteries editor of Book World.

(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) HENIN-BEAUMONT, France - Welcome to Camp Le Pen. It was here - in a small, industrial town in northeastern France - that Marine Le Pen chose to hold her watch party Sunday for the first round of the French presidential election. The symbolism could not have been clearer: In a country where government, media and industry are all concentrated in one city - Paris - this was, well, the anti-Paris. \"It's time to free the French people from arrogant elites who want to dictate their conduct,\" Le Pen, who grew up in a mansion on the outskirts of Paris, in what is one of the most affluent districts in all of France, told her audience. How do you say \"rust belt\" in French? H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, where Marine Le Pen is having her watch party tonight. #election2017 #frenchelection #france A post shared by James McAuley (@mcauley.james) on Apr 23, 2017 at 5:15am PDT In keeping with this theme, the setting was not ornate, and the refreshments on offer - regional delicacies and crustless sandwiches - were far from opulent. It was the sort of spread you might find at an eighth-grade graduation or a church banquet: casual, comfortable and certainly nothing fancy. Although there was champagne after the preliminary results were announced, when Le Pen, along with independent candidate Emmanuel Macron, was named a victor of the election's first round, not a drop of alcohol was in sight for most of the evening. Just Coke in a bottle, sparkling water and juice, things that are (mostly) still free on airplanes. \"Arrogant elites,\" it follows, presumably drink wine. Ever wonder what they serve at a Le Pen rally? #whereisthewine A post shared by James McAuley (@mcauley.james) on Apr 23, 2017 at 10:38am PDT \"I am the candidate of the people,\" Le Pen said, claiming her victory. \"I launch a call to all patriots, wherever they may come from.\" One of these patriots - wrapped in one tricolor French flag, brandishing another - was Jordan Lethoor, a 19-year-old from a neighboring town who checked his cellphone during our conversation about his support for Marine Le Pen and who did not deflect when I asked him why his phone's background depicted a swastika. Le Pen rally, H\u00e9nin-Beaumont #france #frenchelection #election2017 A post shared by James McAuley (@mcauley.james) on Apr 23, 2017 at 11:51am PDT Lethoor said the symbol had to do with a computer game he liked. \"It's true, it's a Nazi symbol,\" he said. \"But I'm not for the Nazis. Adolf Hitler, he killed people like you, and he also killed people like me.\" Lethoor said he was aware of the swastika's meaning, and also that Marine Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, once described the Nazi concentration camps as a \"detail of history.\" \"I don't at all agree with Jean-Marie Le Pen,\" he said. Needs no explanation #frenchelection #france #election2017 A post shared by James McAuley (@mcauley.james) on Apr 23, 2017 at 10:48am PDT Others in the crowd emphasized how Marine Le Pen operates in a reality that others in French politics cannot see. \"I am voting Marine because she is real, because she is French above all. I see a future with her,\" said Martine Le Roy, 62, a retiree in Henin-Beaumont. A woman who would only give her name as Christelle, 45, also from the area, said much the same. \"I find that her program actually corresponds to what our country is today. She's active on the level of wanting to protect the power of her own people.\" Following dark lighting, MLP delivers victory speech for round 1 #frenchelection #election2017 A post shared by James McAuley (@mcauley.james) on Apr 23, 2017 at 12:09pm PDT",

Under your plan, that person is left with 4000 a year.  You see the problem, right?  Whereas the person who made 2,000,000 would be left with 400,000, still plenty to get by on, no?  Not to mention that the millionaires would of course not pay that much (as we noted before).  Besides, a lot of their income wouldn't be salary but capital gains and whatnot, which are taxed much less.

The Hawks now have a chance to even the series with Monday's game in their home gym, with the added motivation of Markieff Morris's \"crybaby\" comments about Atlanta all-star Paul Millsap. Will the Wizards get back on track to go up three-games-to-one or will they squander a chance to put a chokehold on this series? We've got everything you need to know for Game 4. And stay tuned: This story will update throughout the night, including live analysis and highlights. For full coverage of this series, click here. Game information Game 4: Washington Wizards (East's No. 4 seed, 49-33) vs. Atlanta Hawks (East's No. 5 seed, 43-39) Date and time: Monday, 8 p.m. Channel: CSN, TNT Location: Philips Arena, Atlanta Game 1 result: at Wizards 114, Hawks 107 Game 2 result: at Wizards 109, Hawks 101 Game 3 result: at Hawks 116, Wizards 98 Regular season series: Wizards 3, Hawks 1 Remaining schedule Game 5 at Washington: Wednesday, TBD (CSN) Game 6 at Atlanta (if necessary): Friday, April 28, TBD (CSN) Game 7 at Washington (if necessary): Sunday, April 30, TBD (TBD) What you need to know >> John Wall said he saw it coming, imagining how Atlanta would come out with hair-on-fire intensity in Game 3. \"I said, 'we have to withstand their first five minutes,' \" Wall recalled. Although Wall was spot on with his prediction, his warning didn't matter as the Wizards played the first quarter at half speed, allowing 38 points and setting the tone for the rest of the game in which they trailed and chased but never caught up in the 116-98 defeat. Ahead of Game 4, Wall isn't the only player issuing warnings. In order to leave Atlanta with a stranglehold on this round, up 3-1 as opposed to a 2-2 tie, Washington must heighten its sense of urgency, especially at the start of the game. >> The John Wall playoff highlight reel has yet to disappoint. In three postseason games, Wall has produced enough wow moments to satisfy the entire spring, raising his superstar profile and carrying the Wizards in this opening round. And though it has been wonderful and necessary, though you'd be a fool to want less from him, it's time to see more from the rest of the Wizards, writes Jerry Brewer. >> Wizards forward Markieff Morris continues to make the first postseason series of his career a memorable one - mostly with his words. While many players might opt for cliched praise for opponents as to not needlessly stir the pot, Morris has grabbed the biggest spoon he could find and mixed personal animosity into this first-round playoff series. His target: four-time all-star Paul Millsap. \"Good game,\" Morris said after Millsap dominated Game 3. \"He did more for his team tonight. Me as a man, you know, you take your wins with your losses and I take my wins with my losses all the time. You know, he did more for his team. He's a crybaby. You get all the calls and you a crybaby. That's how I'm looking at it.\" >> The gloomy faces on the Wizards' sideline told the story. John Wall sat closest to the coaching staff, a red towel draped his shoulders - there would be no mistaking it for a cape Saturday night, when Wall's individual moments of brilliance went to waste. There are plenty of \"worsts\" - and a few \"bests\" - in this Game 3 wrap up. >> Sports fans don't agree about much. But when the Wizards announced in late March that they would wear their white stars-and-stripes uniforms at all home playoff games this spring, the response seemed pretty close to unanimous approval. There's one issue, though: You can't buy them. >> Before Game 3, Washington was pleased with how the team had been sidelining Dwight Howard and the Wizards were also pleased with their adjustments when Howard is absent. Then the Hawks big man posted a +24 in 26 minutes in Game 3, with only three fouls. >> There's bad blood between John Wall and Hawks guard Dennis Schroder: \"You remember last time we played them in the playoffs, when I broke my hand?\" Wall said. \"You see the picture he posted, going to the conference finals. And I'm just sitting there, like, sad face, with my hand wrapped, and him and Bazemore just laughing. It's just about history. Just history in the game.\" >> It's funny now to remember that, less than a year ago, John Wall and Bradley Beal weren't enough. As a star tandem, they were thought to be malfunctioning - too inconsistent, too many injuries, too much bickering - and most believed the Wizards needed to add another marquee player to be taken seriously. After failing to land that big-name difference-maker in free agency last summer, the future seemed uncertain. Then, Wall and Beal led the Wizards to their best regular season in 38 years, and now they're two victories from advancing to the second round of the NBA playoffs for the third time in four years. But the vibe is different this time. They aren't underdogs showing flashes of becoming an elite backcourt. They have arrived. It took them five years to get here, but if you think that's a long time, it speaks more to impatience than anything Wall and Beal did wrong, writes Jerry Brewer. >> The story of Game 2 may well have been the referees. Endless, constant fouls turned the game into a near-three-hour slog, with the Hawks shooting 38 free throws and Washington firing 33. The crowd provided its evaluation intermittently, chanting, \"Refs, you suck!\" throughout the night. >> Brandon Jennings played an unlikely hero for the Wizards in Game 2. Jennings's number was called with just more than two minutes left in the third with Washington in dire straits, down four points and relying on a short rotation with four players - including its two starting forwards - in foul trouble. Jennings had played 15 minutes in Sunday's Game 1 win at Verizon Center and come up with five assists, but no points and a -10 plus/minus rating. But three days later, just more than a minute into the fourth quarter, the backup point guard hit a step-back jumper to cut the Wizards' deficit to two. Just more than a minute after that, he hit two consecutive jump shots, got a defensive stop, and dished to a cutting Jason Smith for the game-tying dunk. \"Some nights, it might be your night,\" he said. \"But when your number's called, just do what you have to do for the team.\" >> In good times and bad, the Wizards are an excitable bunch. When your best player is an ebullient point guard, when a moody center nicknamed the Polish Hammer mans the middle and when your power forward creates a \"Death Row DC\" alter ego, you're not going to be a laid-back team. Raw emotion fuels and hinders the Wizards. During his first season in Washington, Coach Scott Brooks has attempted to channel that passion, especially with John Wall, writes Jerry Brewer. >> Once again, Bradley Beal bounced back from a rough night, torching the fourth quarter of Game 2 with a 6-of-9 shooting performance (16 points). Beal finished with 31 points (12 of 27 from the floor with four three-pointers), his second career 30-plus total in the playoffs. And he credited his superstar teammate. \"It's great,\" Beal said, responding to John Wall's show of support late in the game. \"Especially John, more than anybody, he doesn't care if I shoot the ball 100 times in a game or how many I make or miss.\" >> The key to the Wizards' Game 2 win? Having their five best players on the floor together, which was more difficult than you'd think. Finally, with the starting unit together through the final 4:35 of the fourth quarter, Washington turned a tie game into a 2-0 series lead. And just like in Game 1, John Wall was the best player on the floor. >> John Wall was incredible in the third quarter of Game 1, but he might have been even better than you think: The Wizards outscored the Hawks by 43.5 net points per 100 possessions in that frame with Wall scoring in transition, off the pick and roll and on drives to the basket. The guard's effective field goal percentage (77.8 percent) was light-years ahead of his regular season performance (48.2 eFG percent). >> A die-hard Wizards fan was crushed by John Wall, who was going for a loose ball late in Game 1. His reaction? \"I took most of the impact for him because we can't afford to have him being hurt, especially with Atlanta being such a dirty team. ... I saved our best player, and if that's what it takes, thank God.\" >> Marcin Gortat was struggling badly but recently he has looked more like the player who once anchored a very good Wizards starting lineup. And all it took was for his backup to get hurt. Gortat's mini resurgence - in Game 82 of the regular season, he made 8-of-9 shots for 16 points against Miami and he outplayed Dwight Howard in Game 1, scoring 14 points (7 of 11) with 10 rebounds and two blocks - comes as Ian Mahinmi recovers from a left calf strain. >> The most interesting comments after Washington's Game 1 win over Atlanta likely came via Hawks star Paul Millsap. \"The difference in the game was we were playing basketball,\" he said, \"and they were playing MMA.\" The Wizards have not attracted any sort of reputation as a brutish team this season, and they spoke of Sunday's debut as a normal affair, spiced with postseason intensity but nothing remarkable. Nonetheless, Markieff Morris later promised \"double MMA.\" So there's that. >> Markieff Morris gave the Wizards their social media nickname, Death Row DC. It's kind of an inside joke. It's also kind of serious. \"Death Row; that's the type of team we are, that's the type of team we want to be,\" Bradley Beal said. Which is what, exactly? \"A physical team that will kind of trash talk you a little bit, and that just don't take no BS,\" Beal said. \"That's pretty much it.\" And Morris's prints are already stamped all over this first-round playoff series. >> This NBA playoff run is the most important of John Wall's career, writes Post columnist Jerry Brewer. It could shatter the false perception that he's a player who is not quite elite. It could elevate Wall, 26, to a level of respect that he'll boldly tell you is overdue. >> How do the Wizards and Hawks match up? We break it down, position by position. >> The Wizards' stunning turnaround from a 2-8 start to a 49-win season began during a 1-2 road trip in December. \"One thing I'll say about this team, nobody threw coach under the bus,\" John Wall said. \" ... Then we started to have a stretch of a lot of home games when we started to win and win and win and finding a way to win a couple games on the road. I think that's what built our confidence back and then we were like, 'We're a pretty damn good team.' \" Here are the five most important games of the Wizards' season. >> The Wizards' last trip to the postseason ended in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. The team that jettisoned Washington? The Atlanta Hawks. This isn't 2015, however, and the Wizards are welcoming this playoff series against the Hawks. Part of that is the addition of Markieff Morris to keep up with four-time all-star Paul Millsap, who has given the Wizards plenty of trouble in the past. \"We've been going at it all year,\" Morris said about playing Millsap. \"It's a matchup I'm definitely looking forward to in the playoffs. We're going to get it in, for sure. It's going to be a good one.\" >> When the Wizards began the season by losing eight of their first 10 games, Ernie Grunfeld's 14-year tenure as the team's general manger was quickly called into question. Washington is now 49-33 and has home-court advantage for the first round. The team's success is in no small part due to Grunfeld, who has held an unshakable belief in the Wizards' core of John Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter Jr., as well as the organization's long-held strategy, referred to simply as \"The Plan.\" Throughout all the ups and downs, Grunfeld remained patient, and now he's reaping the results. >> Scott Brooks calls D.C. a \"magical\" city. You'll be forgiven for thinking Brooks might have a bit of magic about himself. Maybe his first 10 months in this city could have gone better, but it's hard to imagine how. He helped turn a .500 team with a downtrodden fan base into an Eastern Conference heavyweight, boasting the best record in the East since Dec. 1. He won Washington's first division title in 38 years, clinched home-court advantage in the opening round for the first time in 38 years, and flirted with 50 wins for the first time in 38 years. >> The Hawks simply don't have the personnel to keep John Wall, Bradley Beal and Otto Porter Jr. in check. But the Hawks pose a threat inside with the frontcourt combo of Paul Millsap and Dwight Howard, and if Atlanta should win, it will have more to do with how that pair dominates the paint than whether the Hawks stop the Wizards' trio. >> Post NBA reporter Tim Bontemps broke down all of the NBA's first-round matchups ahead of Saturday's kickoff. He predicted the Wizards would win in five games but would need John Wall and Bradley Beal to again play like they have in past postseasons. >> We've got good news and bad news: Washington is the 13th team, including the 1987-88 Bullets, to qualify for the playoffs after starting 2-8 or worse since the NBA playoffs expanded to 16 teams in 1983-84. Now for the bad news: Teams that turned their seasons around after 10 games typically haven't fared well in the postseason. In fact, the 2003-04 Miami Heat is the only team among the previous 12 to reach the postseason after starting 2-8 or worse to win even one series. >> You know who does fear the Wizards? The Cavaliers, at least according to Charles Barkley. The TNT analyst and former star suggested Cleveland might actually prefer to finish second because it means it would avoid the mighty Washington Wizards until the Eastern Conference finals.

                "We just stood around on offense.  On defense, we dropped back  into the key and gave them open threes, again and again and again.\n\nWe need to play to win, not \"not to lose.\"  Low effort doesn't make it even in the regular season, much less the playoffs.", 
                "As if I didn't miss Nene enough.  \nI had to watch Nene do something in the playoffs only Wilt has done, then I had to watch Markieff Morris play pick-and-rolls with Paul Milsap and Schroder like he had never seen either player play a game in his life.  \n\nMarkieff Morris....YO!!!! You are a good player at times!  But when the going gets tough, you fold.  I'm not a KU fan, but I do live in Lawrence, so I can't help but watch them. And you folded then, and are folding now... especially when you start talking smack.     \n\nPull your head out, bruh...playing a Denis Schroder/Paul Milsap pick and pop isn't the best pick-and-pop you will see in your life.  So commit to SOMETHING.   1) The full switch 2) the full pull-through for your guard or 3) The stepping-over the top shoulder of the screener and then trailing screener as he rolls or pops.  Pick something, boss!  Cuz Markieff Morris, you are the weakest link right now.  \n\nAnd on the offensive end....ya ain't a stretch-4 if you aint hitting jumpers or finishing pick-and-rolls...  So stop getting mental,  please.  Hit the dang shots.  You are an excellent shooter.  So have confidence in yourself...cuz right now, you look like the typical KU player (Paul Pierce excluded).  Great frontrunner....weak in adversity.", 
                "I do miss Nene and do not fully understand why we let him get away.\n\nSure, he had a lot of ailments that sidelined him from time to time, but when he was in the game he was an absolute demon.",

                "The Gizzards must turn back into Wizards in game 5 to push the series to 7 games.  Among other Gizzard short comings, like the defense allowing the paint to be an acceleration lane for the Hawks, Morris has badly let the team down with his lackadaisical play against Milsapp.", 
                "Couple of notes.  The bench needs to play better and less.  The Hawks played the ref card to their advantage after the first couple of games, leading to more fouls called on the Wizards.  This in turn blunts the Wizards aggressiveness.  Back in the day, Phil Jackson was the master of crying to the refs.  It works.  The response should have been the same from the Wizards who are not getting the calls they deserve.  Also the Hawks seemed to get more back door easy buckets.  Hopefully the trends will reverse themselves when they get back home.", 
                "The rotations are really out of whack without Mahinmi.  \nYou can see how scared Brooks has become when he has to take Gortat out.  \n\nBut that's life.  They've had better health than most teams throughout the season.  Mahinmi injury is about 20th down on the list of injuries by name.  It just happens to really hurt the Wizards more notably in this particular series.\n\nMahinmi's excellent defensive presence allows him to make Jennings, Bodonovich, and Smith, less notably poor on defense.  Which then enhances their offensive skills.  I mean Bogdo was playing the PF and Smith the C in the second unit tonight.  That's taking them out of their comfort zone.  That's why Wall was in there in weird spots during his normal rest periods.  \nOut-of-whack...and I think they probably will lose the series if Mahinmi does not return for game 5.", 
                "I want to thank the Wizards soooooo much for saving me about $700 tonight.... ($225 a piece for 2 tx,  $40.00 Parking,  $50.00 Jersey for my Lady, $150.00 dinner after the game, and a Nice bottle of Rose' for the Night Cap... I'll keep the night cap them Soft A***** Wh*****se aren't going to spoil that part for me, but wouldn't spend a Red Cent to go see them M***##@$@!$", 
                "Remember the Grunfeld apologist who ran to the board, giddy that Ernie was forced to burn a 1st round pick in-order to clean-up his off-season blunder? Bogdanovic has been exposed as nothing but an occasional hot-streak shooter who disappears if he doesn't get open looks. The bench, which has been an issue all year, are still terrible, and the cause for the team's flatlining.", 
                "The Mahinmi injury really has hurt the rotations...especially in this series.  \nI'm not complaining, because the Wizards had remarkable health for most of the year...but man...Brooks had a really nice rotation going for a little time there...\nAs far as the Bogdanovich comment...ehhhh... maybe so, maybe not.  The 21st pick has had mixed results over time.   \nThe 21st pick has yielded better names  than I thought it would when I looked at it...but in general, I think Ernie does better evaluating current NBA players than he does evaluating draft-eligible guys when he doesn't have a top 20 pick.   \nMany of us could do better than Ernie, if beamed into the GM position.  I am absolutely certain I could...I have documented draft advice on Ted's blog that would have the Wiz with Kawhi AND Draymond.  \nBUT...there's something about having to start out coaching 8th grade girls basketball with girls who hate basketball that kinda takes the steam out of the NBA GM dream.  \nShort-story-long...yeah, a bunch of us could do better, if beamed in...but we can't be...so I guess we have to respect that he has grinded it out to a better roster than about 60% of the other current GM's.", 
                "Horrible game. Coaching stunk and bench stunk Oubre stunk. Fans need to stop talking about Wiz playing in Conference finals. They lose one more game and they are toast.",

                "I'm so disappointed in Morris, especially with the \"front line\" depth depleted with Mahinmi out.", 
                "Schroder plays tremendous basketball against the Wiz, historically.  I will give him that. \n \nHe probably just developed his over-the-line Trash talking as a defense mechanism against always being the ugliest dude in the room.  I can't fault him for that.  Probably got teased a ton as a kid.  \nAnd Starts \"feeling himself\"against the Wizards.  For whatever reason.  Kinda owns us. Probably the most secure he ever feels in life.   Something needs to change in that dynamic.  \nFor what it's worth...somehow I think Oubre is the best suited to guard him.  Maybe Brooks can figure out a rotation that has Wall, Beal, and Oubre on the floor at the same time... with Oubre guarding Schroder.  Without getting burned in some other way (i.e. Atlanta going BIG and suddenly Beal is guarding Paul Milsap)...ya know?", 
                "Atlanta does get all the calls inside so we have to man up and put a wall in front of the basket; communicate and help each other to fight through those switches that leave Beal guarding a big, and throw down some hard fouls. No more freebee dunks.",

            "body": "PARIS - French voters on Sunday rejected the two political parties that dominated France's post-World War II political life, pitting an anti-immigrant firebrand against an unconventional centrist in a presidential election that could determine the future of the European Union and France's place in the world. By picking the pro-E.U. former economy minister Emmanuel Macron and National Front leader Marine Le Pen to advance to the decisive May 7 runoff, French citizens set up a stark choice. Now there will be a battle between a contender who wants to seal France tight against the tides of globalization and another who seeks to strip away even more barriers with the rest of the world. The victor could determine whether the international alliances that formed the backbone of the West after World War II will strengthen or be shattered by the force of nationalism. Le Pen has said she will seek to pull France out of the European Union, a move many leaders on the continent think would doom the 28-nation bloc; she also said she would rekindle relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin after years of strife between Russia and the West. Macron has called for a more muscular European Union in which Europe's richest nations would do more to prop up their poorer neighbors. [WorldViews: What you need to know about the French election] If Le Pen wins, she will continue a global string of ballot-box revolutions that began last year with the British decision to leave the European Union and continued with the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president. With her fierce anti-immigration agenda and her vow to keep France for the French, she could be a Gallic counterpart to President Trump. But if Macron triumphs - and polls suggest he will, by a 24 percentage point margin - it would be a further barrier to transatlantic disruptions, at least for now, after Dutch voters rejected a far-right leader in March elections. (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) At the jubilant Macron rally in Paris, the centrist candidate who was Socialist President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's economy minister told his supporters France would prosper in a revitalized European Union. \"I've heard the anger, the fears of the French people, their fear of change,\" the 39-year-old Macron said, winking at his cheering audience. \"I want to be the president of all patriots against the nationalist threat.\" [A youth revolt in France boosts the far right] At Le Pen's rally in Henin-Beaumont, a northern French town hit hard by factory closures, the modest assortment of soft drinks and snacks gave it more the feeling of a country fair than the celebration of an ascendant presidential campaign - exactly the everyman image Le Pen has sought to project.  \"What is at stake in this election is a referendum for or against lawless globalization,\" Le Pen told the cheering crowd. \"Either you choose in favor of a total lack of rules, without borders, with unlawful competition, the free circulation of terrorists, or you make the choice of a France that protects. \"This is truly what is at stake. It is the survival of France,\" she said. The vote came after a turbulent campaign in which longtime pillars of France's political establishment were either rejected by voters or discredited by scandal. Hollande, the most unpopular of all postwar French presidents, said he would not seek reelection. His most prominent Socialist successor lost to a primary challenger. So did the former center-right president, Nicolas Sarkozy. The early front-runner in the race, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, a right-wing challenger who sought a Margaret Thatcher-style overhaul of France's economy, fell prey to a nepotism scandal. 1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 See photos of French citizens voting for their new president View Photos Centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right leader Marine Le Pen qualify to move on to the second round on May 7th.

Many voters said they were opting for the least bad of an unpalatable slate of options.  \"I want nobody, and it's very complicated. I just don't want to see the extremes,\" said Emma Lacour, 42, who voted Sunday in the upscale Saint-Cloud suburb of Paris, where conservatives usually dominate. \"I decided two minutes ago, and I'm not very happy,\" said Lacour, who was too dispirited to say whom she picked as she walked out of the ornate 19th-century city hall that held the voting station. Thursday's attack on police officers patrolling Paris's glittering Champs-Elysees boulevard was the final, bloody exclamation point in a campaign that often revolved around fears of terrorism and immigrants. One officer died and two were wounded by a gunman who pledged loyalty to the Islamic State. [France's terrorism problem divided the country. The election could make it worse.] Filled with fresh worries about security, voters may have been drawn by Le Pen's growling message about refugees and terror suspects. Macron, a newcomer who is far more conversant with boardrooms than he is with situation rooms, has sought to boost his security bona fides. A former investment banker and a product of France's elite educational institutions, he has described himself as a candidate of neither the left nor the right, and he has never held an elected office. His agenda marries social liberalism with proposals that would dilute France's traditionally robust protections for workers. And - despite prevailing winds that make pro-E.U. sentiment an unlikely campaign strategy - he has embraced the union and said he wants to make it stronger. \"I'm hoping for the renewal of the French political scene,\" said Catherine Grevelink, 56, who oversees legal issues at a bank and voted for Macron in Saint-Cloud. \"He's very intelligent. Now we have to see how this comes out as he governs, if he is president.\" Either of the winning candidates would face questions about governing, since neither has a party structure in France's Parliament. Macron's movement is too new to have any lawmakers, and Le Pen would face steep challenges in capturing a majority of the National Assembly in elections scheduled for June 11. That could potentially be a brake to her more ambitious plans, such as taking France out of the European Union. E.U. membership is enshrined in the constitution, and any change would require approval in both houses of Parliament. Sunday's result is a vindication of Le Pen's years-long strategy to destigmatize her party after decades in which it lurked on France's far-right fringe. Her father notoriously described the Nazi gas chambers as \"a detail\" of World War II. But Le Pen, 48, sought to make inroads among France's large Jewish community and also depicted herself as the single true defender of French workers. \"The laws are there already, but no one applies them, as the attack in Paris showed,\" said Martine Le Roy, 62, a retired insurance worker from Henin-Beaumont. She said she was supporting the anti-immigrant, hard-line Le Pen because she was worried about security. Even as Macron and Le Pen advanced to the next round, the sheer uncertainty in the lead-up to Sunday's vote was a measure of the unmooring of French political life. \"We've had two consecutive presidents, Nicolas Sarkozy and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, very different orientations, very different policies, but still we have the same economic problems,\" said Bruno Cautr\u00e8s, who studies voting behavior at the Center for Political Research at Sciences Po in Paris. \"It has been one of the best arguments of Marine Le Pen: 'Why not me?' \" Although most opinion polls suggest that Macron would win at least 60 percent of a head-to-head vote against Le Pen, an unforeseeable event - such as a large-scale terrorist attack - could shift votes in Le Pen's direction. And the far-left candidate, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, who electrified crowds of young voters with his soak-the-rich message, notably held back Sunday from asking his supporters to vote for Macron in the runoff, raising the prospect that some of his boosters - 19.6 percent of Sunday's voters - could stay home or even vote for Le Pen. Backers of other candidates could also swing to Le Pen. If Le Pen ultimately falls to Macron, she will still have taken the far-right further than any prior candidate in one of Europe's pillar nations. If her rival is elected but fails to live up to expectations, she could seize the presidency in the next election in five years, analysts said. \"If she does well, she could be even stronger in 2022,\" said Jean-Yves Camus, an expert on the French far right at the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs.

But if you check countries like India or China = those are also multinational territories consisting of many internal states (national) just like an EU for example. Ideal of course it if all countries are sharing same liberal values and voluntaliry give up military aspect of solving the problems, but this is an uthopia due to really huge differences in a cultural development (some ocuntries are still in 19th century or beyong even though their elites are globalized).",

            "body": "Results from the first round of the French presidential election are coming in, and centrist Emmanuel Macron and far-right politician Marine Le Pen are emerging as the top two choices of the electorate. As no candidate scored more than 50 percent of the vote, the election will go to a second and final round, set for May 7. This situation is far from a surprise. Most recent polls had shown Macron in front, with Le Pen not far behind, and French presidential elections have gone to a second round every year since 1965, when the current electoral system was implemented. Make no mistake, however: This is already an election for the history books. And if you look at the chart above, you will see why. Centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron and French far-right leader Marine Le Pen on April 23 advanced to a runoff in France's presidential election. The runoff will be held on May 7. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Since the Fifth Republic moved to a direct popular vote method in 1965, the French presidency has been won by a candidate representing either the major center-right political parties (now represented by the Republicans) or the major center-left parties (now the Socialists). Yet this year, neither of those major political groupings will be seen in the second round. Instead, we are likely to see the independent Macron and his En Marche! (Forward!) movement face off against Le Pen, the leader of a once-fringe right-wing movement founded by her father in 1972. This year's election will be the first in which no representative of the Republican-aligned or Socialist-aligned parties makes it through to the second round. It is also only the third time that a party representing something other than these two major wings of French politics has entered the second round. The most recent example of a \"third party\" entering the final round occurred in 2002, when Le Pen's father, Jean-Marie, led the National Front to an unexpectedly good result in initial voting but suffered a landslide defeat in the runoff. The French political world isn't quite the two-party system we see in the United States. Both the Republican-aligned parties and the Socialist-aligned parties have a complicated organizational history. The Republican party was formed after the 2015 renaming of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), which was itself formed by the merging of parties that could trace their ideology to conservative supporters of Charles de Gaulle, founder of the Fifth Republic. The Socialist wing of France had its own evolution over the years, with the Convention of Republican Institutions (CIR) led by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in 1965 merging with other like-minded parties in 1968 to form the Parti Socialiste, or the Socialist Party. Third parties like Le Pen's National Front had long been able to influence politics to a considerable extent, too, in part because of the runoff system used both in presidential and parliamentary elections. However, not so long ago, many experts had argued that this quasi-two-party system was strengthening rather than weakening. What happened this time around? In the Republicans' case, the issue may have been the candidate. Fran\u00e7ois Fillon had run on a platform of traditional Catholic conservative values in a changing France, but his promises of fiscal responsibility and stability took a major hit after allegations that he paid his wife and children 900,000 euros (about $948,000) of government money for work they never did. Meanwhile, Beno\u00eet Hamon of the Socialist Party seemed to struggle because of his association with incumbent Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, a Socialist, who had seen record-low approval ratings as the economy remained sluggish and the country was hit by terrorist attacks. Hamon had also tried to court the far-left vote but struggled against a more charismatic leftist, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. However, the collapse of the mainstream French parties this year also seems to fit into a broader trend of the fragmentation of European political parties, most recently seen in the scattered results of the Dutch parliamentary election in March. Either way, the situation lends an air of unpredictability to not only the presidential race, but also the coming parliamentary elections in France. Traditionally, the party that takes the presidency has aimed to take Parliament, too - the periods in which they cannot are known as \"cohabitation\" in France and tend to feature political deadlock. Without the backing of a major party's political apparatus, a President Macron or President Le Pen might struggle with an uncooperative legislature, though as a centrist and former Socialist, Macron is likely to find more willing allies than his far-right rival would. And it begs the question: Is this a blip, or the new normal?

            "body": "Centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron and French far-right leader Marine Le Pen on April 23 advanced to a runoff in France's presidential election. The runoff will be held on May 7. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) True to the spirit of 1789, the revolutionary French are a step ahead of everyone else. On Sunday, they became the first large Western country to ditch, in a major election, the center-right/center-left political-party structure that has dominated European politics since the Second World War. Neither Emmanuel Macron nor Marine Le Pen, the two candidates who emerged from the first round of voting for the French presidency, belongs to the old gauche or the old droite. Neither will have a major parliamentary party behind his or her program. Neither, as president, would represent a continuation of the status quo. If the most important political divide, in France as almost everywhere else, was once over the size of the state, the new political divide is not really about economics at all. It is about different visions of the identity of France itself. Le Pen, best described as a national socialist, would like to take France out of international institutions, including both the European Union and NATO; block borders; curtail trade; and impose quasi-Marxist state-dominated economics. Her voters are pessimistic about the present and nostalgic for a different France. Her most important foreign ally is Vladimir Putin, whose money funded her campaign, but in recent days President Trump has made positive noises about her, too. Her party, the National Front, has been part of French politics for decades, and has been historically noisy in its opposition to immigration. On the other side is Macron, whose brand-new movement, En Marche - the name means \"forward\" - represents the brand-new radical center. Macron rejects political branding: \"Honesty compels me to say that I am not a socialist,\" he has said, despite having served in a Socialist Party government. He embraces markets, but says he believes in \"collective solidarity.\" His voters are more optimistic about the future, they support the European Union, they embrace France's integration with the rest of the continent and the world: \"You are the new face of French hope,\" Macron told them in his victory speech Sunday night. Though Macron favors strong external borders of the European Union, he expresses no special dislike of immigrants. The foreign politician he most resembles is the young Tony Blair, who also put together a centrist coalition, though it wasn't called that at the time. In this sense, the second round of France's election has a clear agenda: open vs. closed, integrationist vs. isolationist, future vs. past. Unlike her father, who won 18 percent in the second round of the presidential election in 2002, Marine Le Pen is expected to win more, maybe much more, in the May 7 runoff. Though she is far behind Macron right now, a fluke victory cannot be excluded. There is a part of the old left, including those who voted for the Trotskyist, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, who sympathize with her objections to trade, bankers and international business; there is a part of the old right, including those who voted for Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who prefer her ostentatious endorsement of \"traditional values.\" There are many who, confused by the new political divide, will abstain. The smear campaign that will now be aimed at Macron - backed by Russian, alt-right and pro-Trump trolls - is going to be unparalleled in its viciousness. It may well put people off voting altogether. Whatever the final result, Le Pen and her party will not go away. They stand for a set of feelings that are real, that exist in every Western country, and that are now best fought openly, point by point, argument by argument - for they pose a genuine and powerful threat to liberal democracy as we know it. Though the origins of the National Front are indeed fascist - its founders included Vichy sympathizers - it is no good dismissing her candidacy on those grounds. The task now, for Macron and those who will now imitate him, is to find solutions for the many people who reject his \"open\" politics and his centrist vision. Security for the fearful; safety for those who feel threatened, whether by immigration or unemployment; dynamism for static economies. On Sunday night, Le Pen called on French \"patriots\" to support her in the second round. In response, Macron must now define new forms of patriotism, and new forms of solidarity, for those in France who want to remain French but embrace the world.",

                "It sounds like there are scary similarities between France\u2019s runoff and our last general election. You\u2019ve got a corporate establishment centrist, business-as-usual candidate up against a radical reactionary promising to tear everything down in search of former glory. Macron may be more appealing personally and have less accumulated negative baggage than Hillary, but business-as-usual will still be a hard sell for him. And like Trump, Le Pen\u2019s promise of major change may be appealing to many voters whose dissatisfaction with the status quo may overwhelm their misgivings about whether a Le Pen administration would have the capacity or even the inclination to make things better. \n\nOne way the French contest differs from ours is that a Le Pen administration would have nothing but enemies in the French legislature (vs our guy, with his majorities in both chambers) while Macron would enjoy widespread support from both of the legislature\u2019s main parties. That may be a consideration in his favor, or maybe it would enable voters to cast a safe protest vote for Le Pen, secure in the knowledge that the legislature will prevent her from messing things up too much. Hard to guess how it will turn out.\n\nIn one way, though, the French runoff is much different from and undeniably better than the interminable general contest we just endured: it is much shorter.", 
                "So what is it about Russia's economy and society that LePen voters admire? The enormous kleptocracy of Putin and his pals? The murdering of critical journalists and opponents? The takeover of the media? Outlawing of religious groups, just lately the Jehovah Witnesses?  Military threats to neighboring countries?  Meddling in the politics of other countries? Support for a blood thirsty tyrant like Assad? A lousy economy that has only oil, gas and arms to sell and those profits go to guess who?  What would life in France be like with a regime under LePen?",

                "Since the new century and the economic crisis of 07-08, from which we still have not fully recovered, lots of people are worse off. The political establishment was detached and lost touch with these people - a fundamental failure - and they have been paying a price. Many were, of course, on Big Money's payroll. The French system allows new political movements to easily find their audience, hence Macron (and Le Pen). The American two party system blocks that and this meant that an outsider hijacked one party while the other continued \"business as usual\" with unsurprising results.", 
                "Are French voters as easily duped as Americans? Or will facts about Russian/Putinski-buttinski involvement in their election become an issue before the next vote?  It will be interesting to see how France's intelligence agencies handle sharing their findings - before or after the vote.",

                "You will most likely have to go to another source for that kind of coverage.", 
                "I don't think that France will ever be very relevant on the world stage no matter who wins the election.  The EU has turned Paris into a puppet state of Germany since Merkel makes the policy and France has to go along with it.  France thought when the EU was formed that they could dominate it and position themselves as a counterbalance to America, whom they've always resented.", 
                "France is MORE powerful as part of the EU.   What would Kansas be without the rest of the United States?  Only those who DON'T want a strong Europe, want to break up the EU.  Yes, that goes for you Pootie.", 
                "Everybody knows that Germany dominates the EU and make the decisions before telling the others what the policy will be.  Only an anti-western radical like jim/jose/troll would favor the end of Europe as we  know it.", 
                "Your post expresses exactly why many French are ready to vote non-establishment and leave the EU; France has become subject to neocon (US) dominated EU bureaucracy and is indeed playing second fiddle to Germany in the EU Chairman's seat.  \nFrance will become VERY relevant when they exercise an independent foreign policy in places like Ukraine, Syria, relations with China and Russia, etc.  This doesn't mean it will be any prettier than the screwed up EU policies, but it could definitely present a significant alternative to the US controlled EU.", 
                "What's hard to understand is why the French government ever thought that Britain would join them and side against the US.  The UK will always be a stronger ally of the United States than they are to France or Germany.\n\nI can't see a French alliance with Russia working out very well either if that is the direction they're moving.  Yes, it would stick it to the Anglo-American world that France resents, but they would find it hard to work with Russia.", 
                "The EU has turned Paris into a puppet state of Germany? Well that's completely new to me, I always thought The European Union always was a CIA project.  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/04/27/the-european-union-always-was-a-cia-project-as-brexiteers-discov/",

                "Actually, Macron appears to be like Obama except that Obama never rejected the Democratic Party.  Obama campaigned on a new approach to governance (\"There are no red states.  There are no blue states.  There is only the United States\") and tried for a couple of years to bridge the gap between Democrats and Republicans.  In the end, though, political retrenchment forced him to return to the Democratic agenda.\n\nMacron will find, too, that without a party, he will be unable to push any legislation through.  I predict that he will align himself with the Socialists in order to get anything done.  While the voters may want something different, in the end we live in a real society with real people and real interests and politicians have to work with that fabric.", 
                "He left the Socialists just so he could run for the Presidency.", 
                "Yes, I understand that.  But, still, in order to get something accomplished in the National Assembly, he will need the support of either the Socialists or the Conservatives or both.  However, the agenda of those parties are incompatible.  He will have to choose or the other.  \n\nIn short, independents generally don't do very well in governance even though they are attractive to voters.", 
                "Macron is a nobody created by the Rothschilds banking cartel after destroying the true centrist Fillion, who is Christian/Catholic and who would have won hands down.", 
                "Everything about The Establishment that dominates the US, the EU and beyond IS RIGGED.

You can decide which it is.  Instead of using the loaded words like \u201cisolationist: and the abstract but inoffensive \u201cintegrationist\u201d (whatever that is), you could have used the more apposite and common pair \u201cnationalist vs. globalist.\u201d  It is obviously evil in liberal-speak to be an isolationist, but nto everyone has gotten the liberal message that nationalsim per se is also evil. \n\n\u201cOpen\u201d and \u201cclosed\u201d are likewise faulty, so vague as to be meaningless.  In our Facebook-dominated confessional world most people would probably choose to be open when that adjective is connected to nothing at all. But why didn\u2019t you say what you meant and use pro and anti \u201copen borders?\u201d Unless I am mistaken, that is what the left prefers (as a means, presumably, of establishing social justice on a global scale) and now has in the European Union.\n\nLast, the idea that France is choosing between the \u201cpast\u201d and the \u201cfuture\u201d is unworthy of an argument that pretends to intellectual honesty.  Why not use \u201cright track\u201d and \u201cwrong track,\u201d a common polling measure in US elections, to reflect the idea that a substantial portion of the electorate feels that their country is headed in the wrong direction. Or perhaps \u201ctraditional values\u201d versus \u201cprogressive values.\u201d  \n\nAsk yourself why you chose the words you did.

On the  contrary, Macron has promised to be the president of all of France--- https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/23/emmanuel-macron-hailed-by-supporters-as-next-french-president --- which is what the Democrat (Inner) Party in the 2016 election could  not manage to do given their open, and politically fatal, antagonism to working class Americans who are harmed by globalism.  Macron---positioning himself as a liberal progressive with a new approach to French leadership---appears to have learned that fatal lesson well...And that may be enough for him to sweep past Le Pen and her straight-up, hard-core conservative sovereignty approach seeking to use the fear of loss of employment as her calling card.   \n\nWhile it is all too easy point out that the ebullient pro-Macron polling of a large win is all too reminiscent of Brexit and Trump wins in the face of overwhelming poll results to the contrary, Le Pen has some real antagonism to overcome:  her father's comically national socialist losses when he led the National Front party....He was a laughing stock...And the real question is:  Can Le Pen overcome her father's legacy as an authoritarian right-wing pro-Vichy (WWII Nazi collaborationists) anti-semitic politician.",

For decades, the county's public schools have offered a weekly Bible class during the school day - 30 minutes at the elementary level and 45 minutes in middle school. Bible classes on school time are a rarity in public education, but here they are a long-standing tradition. The program is not mandatory, but almost every child in the district attends. And there is widespread support for the classes: Parents and community members help raise nearly $500,000 a year to pay for the Bible in the Schools program. Now Bible in the Schools is facing a stiff legal challenge. Two county residents with school-age children argue in a lawsuit that the program violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment and the West Virginia constitution. Filed in January and amended last month by the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the suit charges that the Bible class \"advances and endorses one religion, improperly entangles public schools in religious affairs, and violates the personal consciences of nonreligious and non-Christian parents and students.\" Supporters are adamant that the weekly class is an elective meant to explore the history and literature of the Bible, not to promote religious belief. [Justices express sympathy with Missouri church at Supreme Court hearing] \"My experience with it has been very positive. I've never known of anyone who has been pressured or felt ostracized,\" said the Rev. David W. Dockery, senior pastor at First Baptist Church of Princeton. \"Any time God's word can be proclaimed is beneficial and is a good thing.\" Trenton's parents also find it hard to see why there would be objections. \"I think it's a great program mainly because it's the only chance for some of these kids to even see the Bible,\" said Brett Tolliver, 27. \"More importantly, I don't know who it harms. The kids aren't forced to be there.\" Courtney Tolliver, 26, a teacher in the district, agrees. \"It's not teaching religion, but it teaches character and respect and how important it is to tell the truth,\" she said. \"The kids love it and the ones who don't participate aren't made to feel left out.\" But the plaintiffs in the suit and their backers argue that the program's popularity shouldn't matter in the face of Supreme Court rulings such as McCollum v. Board of Education in 1948 that have banned public schools from initiating or sponsoring religious activity. The suit alleges that the lessons in the Mercer schools are similar to what a child would hear in Sunday school and that they advocate the Ten Commandments and treat stories in the Bible as historical fact. The suit quotes from one lesson: \"If all of the Israelites had chosen to follow the Ten Commandments, think of how safe and happy they would have been.\" Another lesson asks students to imagine that humans and dinosaurs existed at the same time. It says: \"So picture Adam being able to crawl up on the back of a dinosaur! He and Eve could have their own personal water slide! Wouldn't that be so wild!\" The district declined a request to observe one of the classes. [Can students pray in public schools? Can teachers say 'Merry Christmas'? What's allowed - and what's forbidden] Elizabeth Deal, who describes herself as agnostic, is one of the plaintiffs in the case. Her daughter attended elementary school in nearby Bluefield, but Deal kept her out of the Bible class. Even though the class was optional, Deal said there weren't any alternative lessons or activities for those who opted out. Her daughter was told to sit in the computer lab for that half-hour and read a book. Bypassing the class left her vulnerable to bullying. Deal said other students told her daughter that she was going to hell. One day a student saw her daughter reading a \"Harry Potter\" novel and told her, according to the mother: \"You don't need to be reading this. You need to be reading the Bible.\" Eventually Deal moved her daughter to a public school a few miles away in Virginia where there is no Bible class. She pays an out-of-state fee of several hundred dollars, but she no longer worries about her child being taunted. Deal said she joined the suit because she believes strongly in the separation of church and state. \"When something is wrong,\" she said, \"you have to stand up against it.\" A portrait of Jesus Christ adorns the side of a building in Princeton, W.Va. (Wade Payne/For The Washington Post) God is a big deal in Mercer County, home to about 125 churches that dominate the main streets of its biggest towns, Princeton (population 6,400) and Bluefield (10,400), and smaller burgs such as Athens (1,000), Bramwell (360) and Oakvale (120). A lot of the good jobs in the county have left - 22 percent of its 61,000 residents live below the poverty level - but the churches have stayed. You can find the Church of God here. And the Church of Christ. And the Church of Jesus. There are a couple of Catholic churches, a synagogue and a mosque, but the vast majority of houses of worship are Baptist, Methodist or Pentecostal. The radio in the region is filled with gospel stations, Bible talk shows and Christian rock. Billboards tout the Ten Commandments or offer stern messages on abortion and eternal salvation. Beneath a Chick-fil-A billboard in Princeton, another asks: \"If you die tonight. Heaven or Hell?\" The Rev. Ray Hurt has been the lead pastor at the Church of God in Princeton for more than two decades. The church, one of the largest buildings in town, can hold up to 2,000 people for Sunday services and often does. For Hurt, Bible in the Schools, which has been in the public schools here in one form or another since 1939, is simply a way for students to further their knowledge. \"There is a great deal of not just poetry and prose in the Bible, but from what I've read almost every piece of history that's in the Bible has eventually been proven,\" he said. \"We see the Bible not just as a book of faith but as a pretty accurate account of history that informs us about a lot of things that happened.\" Hurt, whose son, the Rev. J.B. Hurt, is also a minister in the Church of God and a member of the county school board, says he would oppose the program if he thought it was being used to teach religion or if students were required to take the class. But he also embraces the idea that the Bible offers irrefutable lessons in morality and teaches the difference between right and wrong. \"If you read the Bible, you're going to get a whole lot of good ideas that are going to stick with you and make you a better person,\" he said. \"You don't have to push religion with it. It speaks for itself in terms of morals and ethics and those things.\" [Ravitch: Why the Supreme Court should not force the public to pay for religious schools] The idea that a weekly Bible class for 6,600 students in 16 public elementary schools and three middle schools is somehow simply an academic offering doesn't sit well with Lynne White, 54, a former two-term school board member and mother of two sons who went through Mercer schools. \"As a person of faith myself, I don't see any problem with having an after-school Bible program,\" White said. \"But to me this seems a pretty clear violation of the Constitution.\" White holds the school board and leadership responsible for spreading what she says is a false sense of what the Bible in the Schools program is and does. In a commentary for the Charleston Gazette-Mail, White wrote that \"the Bible in the schools program in Mercer County is being sustained on a foundation of lies.\" She argued that the classes are character education based on biblical values, that they were not electives because West Virginia doesn't offer electives in elementary or middle school and that even though the classes are funded by private donations, that doesn't mean they should be taught during the instructional day. She also said it was untrue that children who didn't take the class weren't made to \"feel different or ostracized.\" When White posted the article on Facebook, she heard from some supporters, but many others questioned her faith. \"I will pray for you and all non-believers Lynne White. God Bless!!\" one wrote. Another wrote: \"Lynne White You are not a Christian, a Christian is a person who strives to be more Christ like with everything they do and I do not believe Christ would be working to shut this program down or alter it to include your worldly views.\" The Rev.

(Wade Payne/For The Washington Post) Mohammad Iqbal at the Islamic Center of the Islamic Society of the Appalachian Region in Princeton, W.Va. \"It should be optional, not enforced,\" he says of the Bible class. (Wade Payne/For The Washington Post) If it were simply a popularity contest, Bible in the Schools would be allowed to continue as is. Even the president of the local mosque in Princeton says it should stay. \"It's good to be God-fearing no matter how you approach it,\" said Mohammad Iqbal, head of the Islamic Society of the Appalachian Region. \"Whether it's the Bible, whether it's Koran, whether it's Torah, whether it's some other book. But it should be optional, not enforced. If the parents have no objection and the student has no objection, it is okay.\" But the program's fate will not be resolved by popular vote or on Facebook posts. Instead, the question will be tried in the courtroom of Judge David A. Faber of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia in Bluefield. (Faber was nominated by President George H.W. Bush.) Representing the Mercer school district is the First Liberty Institute, a nonprofit law firm based in Texas that specializes in religious freedom cases. Hiram Sasser, a lawyer at the firm, said the district's main objective is to allow the Bible course to remain as an elective while making sure it complies with the law. The district filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit on Wednesday. \"There are two things to look at,\" Sasser said. \"The first is whether you can have a Bible course at all. And the other is whether you can have the Bible course as it is presently constituted. It's fair to say that we're very confident on the first issue. And on the second issue . . . our client is very, very flexible in terms of making sure that the content is in compliance with the law.\" But the plaintiffs aren't looking for flexibility. They want the Bible class out of the school day. Children play at Mercer Elementary School in Princeton, W.Va. (Wade Payne/For The Washington Post) The program \"is unconstitutional at its core and cannot be saved via modifications,\" said Patrick Elliott, a lawyer with the Freedom From Religion Foundation. \"There is no legally permissible way for Mercer County Schools to continue with any type of program like this.\" According to Elliott, the Mercer program is \"extremely rare\" and there are only a handful of districts around the country with similar courses. [Supreme Court sends Virginia transgender case back to lower court] The amended complaint, Elliott said, seeks to prevent the school system from \"organizing, administering, or otherwise endorsing Bible classes for Mercer County Schools' students in grades kindergarten through eighth grade.\" Charles C. Haynes, the founding director of the Religious Freedom Center at the Newseum in Washington, doesn't foresee the program surviving a court challenge in its current form. \"This is a loser for the school district,\" Haynes said. \"It's difficult to satisfy the First Amendment in elementary school when it comes to the Bible. Students at that age really aren't prepared to tell the difference between what is history and what is religious conviction.\" Haynes argues that people of faith are doing their religion a disservice when they try to have it taught by a government entity. They would rightly object, he said, if they lived somewhere where they were the religious minority and supporters of another religion wanted a course on their faith taught in public schools. \"Even if 99.9 percent of the people in the community want it, they need to remember that liberty of conscience is not up for a vote,\" he said. Trenton Tolliver is oblivious to the Bible battle that swirls around him. His first-grade school year ends next month. Hanging in the balance of the court case is what he will learn in the Bible course in second grade. Or if there will be a Bible course at all. A sign welcomes people to Princeton, W.Va.

Then, religion was a required course and it was Protestant indoctrination; the teacher, we were told, was not a county employee. Class started with a prayer, followed by bible study.  You could only get out of the class if your parents came to school and did something [I never quite knew what exactly].  My parents were working class folks who I knew would never come, short of my being expelled.  So, the plan that evolved was for some of us to make the teacher cry every day by being total \u201cheathens\u201d. And it worked after about a month or so.  \nWe [the \u201cheathens\u201d] the ended up in study hall as a form of punishment and for me that was like Brier Rabbit asking the fox to not cast him into the briar patch.  Once the librarian discovered that I was not there to be a PITA and was thrilled to spend the hour quietly reading, it became a wonderful place to be.  When she needed help shelving books, I willingly helped and learned the Dewey decimal system and after two years read my way through all of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Steinbeck, John O\u2019Hara, James Jones, etc and developed a huge appetite for reading.  Later I learned that students whose parents came to school were assigned an extra PE class.  Bluefield in those days was a place where, if you were Catholic you were suspect and if you were Jewish you told no one [only after college did I discover some of my friends were Jewish].  Basically, in the eyes of the middle / upper classes, if you were not a WASP, then you were likely on your way to Hell.  It was a class bound city, segregated, racially, and socio-economically.\nI heard years later, that the religion classes were dropped from the high school; it appears that they just moved them down to the elementary school because little kids are more compliant that high school students.  \n\nSomethings never change back there!",

Why don't the court decisions on religion in school apply to WVA? Are they not part of the USA? We have to fight this nonsense now and then in FL, too.

Point is, if parents want their children educated in Christian doctrine on a daily basis and are willing to fund it, and is obvious they do; then hold an after school class in that subject and present it in the context as such. If it is presented during the school day, it should be offered in the same way as any other social studies class of like topic and those topic covered as well.

Of course my parents paid tuition monthly so I could hear that ---in addition to getting a fairly good education, and also had Lutheran friends and  also told me that Sister Timothy... may have been a bit overenthusiastic in her lesson...and that different people had different religious beliefs, and we should never belittle them because of it.\n\nGranted, we didn't have the school bus issue in the city, and kids went to school within walking distance, but the way I recall it working then was all public elementary schools ended their day an hour early on Wednesday, calling it teachers work hour or marking time or such, as did Catholic schools let out an hour early. The Catholic kids went home the hour early, as did the heathens.  The kids in public schools whose parents had enrolled them in catechism classes  walked the two blocks to the Catholic school for catechism class there on Wednesday afternoons.

That\u2019s the sole purpose of Christmas, no matter how \u201csecular\u201d the masking.  Does \u201cSanta\u201d visit your school in December?

She drove the peg through his temple into the ground and he died.\u201d\nI'm sure there's a lesson there somewhere.\n\nDeuteronomy, Chapter 25:\n\u201cIf two men are fighting and the wife of one of them comes to rescue her husband from his assailant, and she reaches out and seizes him by his private parts, you shall cut off her hand. Show no pity.\u201d\nNice images, especially for school children.\n\nExodus, Chapter 32:\n\u201cThen he [Moses] said to them, \u201c'This is what the Lord, God of Israel says: \u201cEach man strap a sword to his side. Go back and forth throughout the camp from one end to the other, each killing his brother and friend and neighbor'\u201d The Levites did as Moses commanded and that day about 3,000 of the people died.\u201d\n\nNice stuff. And for those Bible thumping Christians who try to explain away this garbage by saying \u201cThat's the Old Testament and it's been replaced by the New Testament. It doesn't apply anymore\u201d (or some such nonsense), \u201cGod\u201d says in Isaiah 40:8, \u201cThe grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God will stand forever.\u201d\n\nHere's what Founding Father Thomas Paine had to say about the Bible:\n\"Whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and tortuous executions, the unrelenting vindictiveness with which more than half the Bible is filled, it would be more consistent that we call it the word of a demon than the word of God. \n\"It is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and, for my part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest everything that is cruel.\u00a0[Thomas Paine,\u00a0The Age of Reason]", 
                "To Harry Knight-No, the Bible has NOT been PROVEN to be historically accurate time and time again. It was never even intended to be a historical document to begin with. It's a mix of early mythology and later tales based in history but written with a moral in mind. And this isn't even getting into the nonsense of looking at the early books in Genesis as a substitute for real science about the formation of the earth.  Here's an example: The only census by the Roman empire in the time of Jesus' childhood was taken in AD 6. So that would be about 10 years after Herod the Great died, and five years after Jesus' birth. Even so, it didn't require anyone to travel to the home of their ancestor.  So that biblical story simply doesn't line up with real history.  Another example is  that the archaeology simply doesn't support the story of the Conquest of Canaan as described in the Bible. As for the flood story-a worldwide flood never happened. The whole idea is laughable. But there are stories in cultures from this region and evidence that the Caspian was prone to large flooding. So the only history here is that people did experience floods and it is entirely possible that a local farmer managed to save his family and his livelihood by loading pairs of his livestock into a boat. But the story of the ark was first written (to our knowledge, at least) in the Epic of Gilgamesh, long before. Of course there were no dinosaurs, except the chickens.

How many do you think would believe in what they were now being taught, and how many would dismiss the lessons as non-sense? I suspect the number of new believers would be quite low indeed. How many persons of faith think Scientology is pure silliness? I imagine many do. But if you think about it, is the story of Scientology any less credulous than the stories from the Bible?

My parents raised me without religion and without taking any position on religion pro or con. My only exposure to world religions was through mythology books by Thomas Bulfinch and Edith Hamilton. Admittedly, I did get introduced to Christianity slightly before your time limit, since I started participating in a youth marching band at the age of twelve that rehearsed in a church and, once a month, played at that church's services as a sort of quid pro quo. But still, close enough. I was skeptical of the Christian claims I was hearing in that church, and I was equally skeptical when I started studying other world religions. I had always had a vague notion that I was a nonbeliever, but about the age of twelve and thirteen, I decided to investigate the subject to see what it actually was I didn't believe in. So I not only read about Christianity, but Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Shinto, etc., etc., etc. John R. Hinnels' \"A Handbook of Living Religions\" was my primary guide and it was awesome. Scholarly without being affected and unbiased to the last. I also read religious texts, such as the Bible for the first time (KJV), the Qur'an (N. J. Dawood translation, and I've since also read M. A. S. Abdel-Haleem's), etc. I also read books on atheism, although they were harder to get a hold of, since I was doing this in the early 90s, before so-called \"New Atheism\" generated a flood of popular-level books on atheism. The only layman's level book in print was George H. Smith's \"Atheism: The Case for the Non-Existence of God\". So of necessity, I had to read philosophy of religion, and that led me into broader examinations of philosophy. All that happened was that I went from being a tacit nonbeliever to an intellectually engaged nonbeliever. I never found religious claims credible.",

            "body": "The Joffrey Ballet performs a piece by Tony-winning choreographer Christopher Wheeldon. (Teresa Wood) Kennedy Center President Deborah Rutter is fond of saying she runs an artist-driven institution. The center's \"Ballet Across America\" series, which ended Sunday and was curated by choreographer Justin Peck and ballerina Misty Copeland, put that label into practice. The question is: What was gained by empowering artists to create the audience experience, instead of relying on administrative staff? Ballet Across America is one of the Kennedy Center's best ideas, and something it is uniquely suited to bring about. Every two years or so (the series debuted in 2008), it brings together regional troupes from around the country that otherwise would not have the occasion to perform in the nation's capital to show their best work in shared programs. Past years have revealed an inspiring breadth of artistry across the land. Two memorable examples: the Sarasota Ballet in a sparkling account of Frederick Ashton's seldom-seen ice-skating delight, \"Les Patineurs,\" in 2013; and in 2010, the poetry of Ballet Memphis in Trey McIntyre's \"In Dreams,\" beautifully accompanied by the ragged emotions of Roy Orbison. The center's dance programmers presumably put the series together the way they design the ballet season as a whole, aiming first for excellence, as well as a balance of tone - upbeat as well as contemplative, conventionally balletic as well as fresh and contemporary, and so on. This year, for the first time, the center went outside the box, handing the wheel to Peck and Copeland, who each composed a program that ran for three performances. Copeland's stated aim was diversity: For her program, which ran Wednesday through Friday, she picked Nashville Ballet, whose leading dancers include African American ballerina Kayla Rowser; the Black Iris Project, primarily African American dancers with an African American choreographer/director; and Complexions, the contemporary ballet troupe in New York led by the seasoned African American choreographers Dwight Rhoden and Desmond Richardson.  Complexions performs \"Star Dust,\" choreographed by Dwight Rhoden. (Teresa Wood /Teresa Wood ) It was Rhoden's \"Star Dust,\" a tribute to David Bowie, that closed what had been a rather measured program with an A-bomb. This was simply one of the most exciting performances I've seen on the dance series, less a rock ballet than a rock concert, with Complexions' extraordinary male dancers strutting right to the lip of the stage to lip-sync \"Changes,\" \"Life on Mars\" and other songs while the ensemble twisted and pranced behind them, and the whole work gobbling space with huge appetite. Rhoden is not only an inventive and fearless choreographer, he's also a gifted traffic cop. Deft crowd management was a plus here. If Copeland's program seemed to focus mostly on alluring individual dancing, Peck chose works that appealed to his craftsman's eye. His program Saturday and Sunday featured L.A. Dance Project, the group run by former Paris Opera Ballet director and celebrated choreographer Benjamin Millepied; the Joffrey Ballet, in a piece by Tony-winning choreographer Christopher Wheeldon; the well-traveled New York modern-dance troupe Abraham.In.Motion, led by Kyle Abraham (also African American, continuing the series' emphasis on diversity), and an excerpt from Peck's \"Year of the Rabbit,\" performed by two Miami City Ballet members. What was gained by these different approaches? This new turn for a long-running series offered a fine presentation of sporadic gems. Both programs had meaningful strengths: They offered a glimpse of new talent for the center's ballet audiences and gave an opening to a few luminaries who should return. With the success of Millepied's quicksilver \"Hearts & Arrows,\" I'd like to see a full engagement of L.A. Dance Project. He created this work in 2014, accompanied by Philip Glass's String Quartet No. 3 (elegantly performed live at the Kennedy Center). \"Hearts & Arrows\" has a pronounced edge while also being solidly constructed, progressing toward a concluding note of breathtaking poignancy. The L.A. Dance Project in Benjamin Millepied's \"Hearts & Arrows.\" (Teresa Wood/Teresa Wood) Abraham.In.Motion in Kyle Abraham's \"The Gettin'.\" (Teresa Wood) The eight excellent dancers wore black ankle booties (hooray for added support for high-impact footwork) and shorts or skirts in a graph-paper pattern. Vertical lighting totems struck an industrial note. Amid the sharp angles, Millepied directed the eye to moments of warmth - a woman bounding away from her partner to throw herself protectively in front of the ensemble, guarding them from some evil; a man rising from a tight circle of dancers, as though he's been birthed by their collective spirit. At the end, as the dancers lined up in progressive states of unfolding, it felt as though we were watching the evolution of something noble, vulnerable and interconnected in the human species. Throughout Ballet Across America, the greatest moments were the simplest. It was lovely to encounter Rowser in Nashville Ballet's \"Concerto,\" created by Paul Vasterling, the artistic director. Rowser was the standout in this busy work with her calm, ease of movement and understated charm. In a similar vein, the Washington Ballet's Andile Ndlovu was introduced to a broader audience in Jeremy McQueen's \"Madiba,\" for McQueen's Black Iris Project. This piece sketched moments from Nelson Mandela's life, and while correlating a dance with a great historical figure and an exceptional historical moment born of decades of struggle is difficult, Ndlovu's sensitive portrayal of Mandela, with whom he has an intimate connection (Ndlovu hails from Johannesburg), was a reward. Interestingly, South Africa's racial conflicts also figured in Abraham's \"The Gettin', \" with a terrific live jazz band playing Robert Glasper's interpretation of \"We Insist! Max Roach's Freedom Now Suite.\" Here, too, the political overtone, highlighted in photographic projections of violence, proved a heavy burden for a dance to carry. It's easy to see why Wheeldon's intricate partnering and the shapes he created in \"Fool's Paradise\" appeal to Peck as a choreographer. The Joffrey dancers looked splendid, like molten gold, in the 2007 work.  Both programs opened with a new brief film by former dancer Ezra Hurwitz titled \"Now More Than Ever,\" in which American Ballet Theatre principals whirled through various Kennedy Center sites. Now more than ever, we need the Kennedy Center, I guess we are to think: Commissioned by the center, the film seems destined to play on the video screens in its hallways. It's a pretty piece of work, though a bit out of place in a tribute to live art and to curators found outside the center's walls.",

The fire began about 8:30 a.m. on the top floor of a three-story apartment building and quickly spread to the roof, county fire department spokesman Mark Brady said. The complex is in the 2500 block of Corning Avenue in Fort Washington. Brady said numerous residents needed help getting down from their balconies. One woman on a middle floor handed her baby to others on the ground level before climbing down, Brady said. Five people were evaluated for injuries and two were hospitalized: the woman in her 80s, who landed on a grassy patch, and her daughter, who is in her 60s and was brought down by ladder. The three others included a firefighter who fell ill fighting the blaze but eventually returned to duty, officials said. The fire appeared accidental, Brady said, with damage in the $150,000 range. - Faiz Siddiqui Man struck by car is critically injured A man was struck by a car and critically injured Sunday in the Oxon Hill area, Prince George's County police said.

            "body": "Gov. Terry McAuliffe bounded into the spare offices of a start-up incubator to make a rapid-fire pronouncement: He will spend the last nine months of his term trying to make Virginia \"the capital of automated vehicles.\" It was his economic development-meets-standup routine, and the commonwealth's salesman in chief had industry leader California and other rivals in mind. With more than 280 wineries, Virginia is already on the Golden State's heels in a crucial industry, the argument went. \"They're going to think Napa is an auto parts company!\" Mc-Auliffe (D) jabbed, knocking the \"lighter fluid out there.\" And driverless cars and drones, in air and water, are next up. \"I want to own the land, the water and the sky,\" McAuliffe told the roomful of tech execs and mobility wonks in Arlington County. \"We're going to bury those other 49 states. Worthless!\" It's a goal shared by officials around the country, although often expressed with less competitive glee. Michigan, with its auto industry roots, has fought for a leading role, as has Pennsylvania, home to Carnegie Mellon University, which is among the institutions at the forefront of driverless-vehicle research. Texas, Massachusetts, Arizona and others are in the mix, too. Virginia is for Lovers - and driverless technology, according to Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D). (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) But Virginia's approach also shows the pressures states face as they try to get a bigger foothold. In contrast to California, which is pursuing the nation's most comprehensive regulations on self-driving vehicles, Virginia officials have made their lack of legislating and rulemaking a prominent part of their sales pitch. \"We have no rules that prohibit autonomous vehicles, no law. A lot of states do,\" said Virginia Transportation Secretary Aubrey Layne. \"That's intentional that we're doing that.\" Some who believe robocars are barreling ahead too quickly are skeptical of Virginia's approach. \"Honey always attracts the bees,\" said Joan Claybrook, a consumer advocate who headed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration under President Jimmy Carter and lives in the District. \"They're very different approaches. California is thinking of itself as a regulator. They're overseeing the system. And Virginia is thinking of themselves as having a business opportunity.\" [Will driverless cars really save millions of lives? Lack of data makes it hard to know.] Multiple approaches California is in the midst of a major regulatory struggle that shows both the perils and potential promise of trying to bring clarity to the fast-growing industry. The long-running effort could be completed soon after a public hearing Tuesday. The state's eagerness to get out front has \"made it more difficult for the industry,\" said Stan Caldwell, executive director of Traffic21, a research institute at Carnegie Mellon. States' urge to act can bring unintended consequences, he said. \"The states are all trying to do the right thing. They're trying to get industry there. They're trying to keep it safe. But they can't keep up with the technology curve,\" Caldwell said. Federal officials will need to evaluate whether all the state-by-state approaches are \"interoperable,\" Caldwell said. Some states have been combining their efforts, he added, citing Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan's \"Smart Belt Coalition.\" That's a play on Rust Belt, and it's meant to promote driverless progress across state lines. The District is working with London, Helsinki and other cities to plan for the technology's adoption. Maryland has called for testing on its stretch of the Interstate 95 corridor. But with dozens of companies working on the technology in the nation's most populous state, California remains a high-profile test case - and target. In 2014, California required companies to apply for permission and make various disclosures when their autonomous cars are tested on the state's roads. Today's regulations require a person be at the wheel and ready to take control, if needed. Google's Waymo team, Ford and a host of others are testing there. Last year, California officials revoked registrations for Uber's self-driving cars after the company argued that the rules didn't apply to them. In response, Uber, which is based in San Francisco, trucked its cars to Arizona. The firm has since acceded to California's rules and is back testing there as well. In 2015, California's Department of Motor Vehicles began releasing draft regulations that would govern broader deployment of the cars. Last year, the state proposed requiring firms to obtain a resolution from local governments before testing cars without drivers in their neighborhoods. But industry representatives said that would drag them into endless quagmires. That requirement has been stricken from the latest draft rules. Firms instead would need to provide communities notice and describe how they will operate. Companies would be required to provide a copy of responses to a voluntary 15-point safety checklist the U.S. Transportation Department created last year, and they also would need to certify that sufficient testing has been done to ensure safety. Virginia, meanwhile, has tried not to do anything the industry might view as a roadblock. \"We haven't done any regulations, because we just don't know yet,\" McAuliffe said, adding that he won't do anything to \"stymie\" innovation. Layne has cited Uber's run-in with California authorities, and traveled to Uber's driverless technology headquarters in Pittsburgh to talk to the company about working with Virginia. [Uber's driverless \"Pittsburgh project\" is response to what company sees as existential threat] California officials reject the narrative that they are scaring away a potential cash cow. Apple obtained a California permit this month, and the state is doing important groundwork, they say. \"To see the possibility that we could have completely driverless vehicles on our roads by the end of the year is a pretty big deal,\" said Jessica Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the California DMV. Clarity will be a competitive plus, she said. \"It's definitely an advantage. . . . It's a big responsibility, and we're really excited about the proposed regulation.\" 'We really left Virginia open' In Virginia, no applications or permits are required, and \"a lot of times the companies that are testing don't share the information with us,\" Assistant Transportation Secretary Ronique Day said. \"We really left Virginia open, to not create any additional process and red tape.\" Virginia officials say the central question about whether state law allows cars without drivers comes down to an interpretation of the commonwealth's traditional motor vehicle code. The code defines an \"operator\" or \"driver\" as a person who drives or \"is in actual physical control\" of a vehicle. That has traditionally meant being in the car. But it does not necessarily preclude someone maintaining control remotely, officials said. Despite some high-profile crashes of driverless vehicles elsewhere in the country, McAuliffe said the technology will be a step up from the status quo. \"Safety's always a concern. It's going to make us safer,\" McAuliffe said. He noted that speed and alcohol cause vast numbers of road deaths. With driverless vehicles, \"the car ain't stopping off doing shots of whiskey.\" Beyond its big regulation-free welcome mat, Virginia has other major selling points, officials said. A network of newish, privately run car-pool and toll lanes could help integrate autonomous vehicles into real-world traffic in big numbers in coming years, Layne said. While driverless cars are expected to carry passengers on short hops around congested cities, Layne thinks Virginia's express lanes along I-495, I-95 and elsewhere can provide an attractive, free-flowing environment. \"The whole idea is going to be to get the utility out of the cars\" by getting people where they're going quickly and easily, he said. The state has worked with the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute to turn 78 miles along those express lanes and on Interstate 66, U.S. 50, U.S. 29 and U.S. 234 into what they call the Virginia Automated Corridors. They've done high-end mapping and put in roadside equipment that can talk to cars, and researchers have worked with driverless firms to test in those areas. Virginia Tech also manages a state \"smart road\" near its campus, complete with snowblowers and monitoring equipment, that has been used to test technology from Google and others. The state has set aside $25 million a year for technology along its roadways, including to help facilitate autonomous vehicles, Layne said. And Virginia's constellation of military, intelligence and state facilities are potent resources for in-air and underwater drones, making Virginia a triple threat, said Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), the top Democrat on the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence. Warner has for years sought to make the state the top locale for developing unmanned technologies for defense and commerce. \"While we have competitors in each arena,\" he said, \"I want Virginia to be viewed as the most friendly toward unmanned systems.\" The state is set to formally open a new, 3,000-foot drone runway next month at NASA's Wallops Island facility on Virginia's Eastern Shore. That will allow small commercial drones - and bigger military and intelligence-grade ones - to take off and land without hassle and fly freely, officials said. Virginia is repairing a dock nearby so unmanned flights can link with underwater test missions there, and it is installing a facility to discreetly put small satellites aboard drones for defense-related testing, officials said. \"We're not just looking at these technologies and these evolutions in their silos,\" said Karen Jackson, the commonwealth's secretary of technology. Researchers at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science will use autonomous kayaks and drones to view Eastern Shore sediment from different angles simultaneously, she said. Similarly, the state's concentration of cyber-security experts is valuable for research in autonomy, she said. Always another issue In California, there has been a mix of resignation and cautious optimism in tech circles that the industry will be able to work with that state's latest regulatory approach. Many of the top companies are headquartered there, and driving on hometown roads is a point of pride. But potential flash points continue to appear. The latest was a bill that would have required autonomous cars be electric or otherwise have zero emissions. That would exclude most current players, though not the Chevy Bolt EV or Teslas. A state Senate transportation committee analysis said the bill would likely have required \"low maximum speeds and close following distances, which sounds like a perfect recipe for inciting road rage.\" Opponents sidelined the proposal, amending it to call for a task force to recommend policies that would \"maximize the environmental benefits and minimize the air pollution, traffic congestion, and land use impacts of autonomous vehicles.\" Still, some elsewhere see opportunity in the state's regulatory efforts. \"Usually California gets in its own way,\" Warner said. \"That's been an advantage for us.\"",

            "body": "BALTIMORE - The Orioles stood on the verge of a three-game sweep of the Boston Red Sox on Sunday. Just not for very long. The Red Sox greeted Orioles starter Kevin Gausman with four straight hits before there was an out made in the first inning, the last two of which landed beyond the reach of anyone in the Orioles outfield, for back-to-back home runs. That was about it. The Orioles offense had no answer against former teammate Eduardo Rodriguez, who took a no-hitter bid into the fifth inning on the way to a 6-2 victory before an announced 35,522 at Camden Yards that ended the Orioles' four-game winning streak. Rodriguez, who was dealt to the Red Sox for premier setup man Andrew Miller in 2014, retired the first nine batters he faced and allowed just the one hit over six innings. He had trouble finding the strike zone in the middle innings and walked five batters to create a couple of scoring opportunities for the Orioles, but got the outs he needed to keep them off the scoreboard. The closest the Orioles came to making a game of it came in Rodriguez's final inning of work, when Trey Mancini came to the plate with two outs and the bases loaded, every runner having reached base on a walk. Mancini worked a tough at-bat before lining a pitch sharply to third baseman Pablo Sandoval, who dropped the ball but was able to make the force play at second to end the inning. The Red Sox had some frustration to vent after losing the first two games of the series and veteran second baseman Dustin Pedroia to a knee injury in Friday's opener. They didn't waste any time taking it out on Gausman. Xander Bogaerts and Andrew Benintendi opened the game with back-to-back singles, and Mookie Betts launched a three-run homer to left field. Moments later, Hanley Ramirez followed suit, and the 4-0 lead remained unchanged until Mitch Moreland hit a towering homer to center field in the fifth. Gausman settled down in between, retiring 11 of the next 14 batters after Ramirez's homer, but that was a small consolation on a day when he hoped to wipe away the memory of Tuesday night's eight-run meltdown against the Cincinnati Reds. On Sunday, he allowed five earned runs on eight hits over 5 1/3 innings and is now 1-2 with a 7.50 ERA. The Red Sox also seemed to take their anger out on Manny Machado two days after his hard slide knocked Pedroia out of the series. Reliever Matt Barnes was ejected from the game in the eighth inning after throwing a 90-mph pitch behind Machado's head. The incident halted the game for a prolonged period while Boston manager John Farrell argued with the umpires and the two teams glared across the field at each other, but there was no on-field confrontation. The consecutive home runs by Betts and Ramirez were the first set of back-to-back homers by the Red Sox this year. The Orioles have done it twice - both times by Mancini and Jonathan Schoop, and both times against the Red Sox. Adam Jones, who singled in the eighth inning, has hit safely in eight of his past nine games. Perhaps more impressive, he has failed to hit safely in just two of the Orioles' 17 games. His consistency has not resulted in a gaudy batting average, as he's batting .269, but he has three home runs, nine runs scored and eight RBIs in 66 at-bats. - Baltimore Sun",

            "body": "IS THE president's softened tone on China a strategic choice, or does it reflect his daughter Ivanka's extensive business ties to the country? Was the early camaraderie between President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe influenced by a business deal between Ms. Trump's company and a state-associated Japanese firm, after the president's daughter sat in on a meeting with Mr. Abe? Probably not; yet such questions inevitably arise given the combination of Ms. Trump's business entanglements and her White House role. The entanglements would have been concerning if she had never entered the White House. Playing both roles puts America's reputation on the line. Foreigners must wonder: Is the United States a country where government actions are intertwined with the private interests of the president's family? What does the United States surrender in ethical standing when the president's daughter is both a close adviser and a businesswoman with operations that depend on the goodwill of foreign governments? The Associated Press reported last week that \"global sales of Ivanka Trump merchandise have surged and the company has applied for at least nine new trademarks in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Canada and the U.S.\" Ms. Trump's company secured valuable trademarks in China on the same day she helped welcome Chinese President Xi Jinping to Mar-a-Lago on an official visit. Ms. Trump and her advisers say that she has relinquished most control over the business to a trust run by her family members. Why not just sell her business? Because, they may say, its value is based on her personal branding, so the Trump name and reputation would still be for sale. Why not establish a blind trust? Because retaining some control allows her to reject potentially shady deals. Won't she run afoul of White House ethics rules if she offers advice on, say, trade with China? Executive-branch rules have permitted certain conflicts of interest in the past, and she can recuse herself on a case-by-case basis, with advice from lawyers and government ethics experts. But the fact remains that foreign governments will see approving trademark applications, financing and business deals as a way to curry favor with the U.S. government. As long as Mr. Trump is president, would a country such as China ever reject an Ivanka trademark application? For decades, the United States has advocated the principle that official corruption is a scourge to be stamped out, above all by isolating government from the private interests of those in power - and of their families. This principle is enshrined in the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits Americans from participating in the bribery that undermines so many foreign economies. The risk now is that the Trump administration will taint that advocacy, allowing foreign leaders to argue that the United States is no better than any Central Asian dynasty. Rather than defending a narrow legal case, the Trumps should be bending over backward to avoid any suggestion of hypocrisy. Ms. Trump can be an adviser on foreign affairs; her business should not simultaneously be expanding or seeking rights and benefits overseas.

            "body": "MYRIAD FORCES pull girls from school across poor swaths of the globe. One is menstruation, long a taboo subject that causes fear and shame, and as a practical matter forces girls to miss school for lack of basics such as sanitary pads or toilets. Stella Nyanzi, a firebrand activist in Uganda, spoke up about this, criticizing the wife of Uganda's president, and is now in jail because of it. Ms. Nyanzi, a mother of three and an academic, is a controversial figure who champions LGBT rights in a land where homosexual acts are outlawed. She often shocks people to get attention, such as the time she undressed on television, and frequently uses vulgar language while lighting up social media to prod the powerful. Her latest campaign involved a broken promise by Uganda's autocratic President Yoweri Museveni, who has held power for three decades and was reelected in February 2016 amid reports of voting irregularities, ballot-box stuffing and intimidation of opposition candidates. In the campaign, the president and his wife Janet, who is also education minister, promised to fund free sanitary pads for girls in Uganda. But earlier this year, Ms. Museveni told parliament that the promise wouldn't materialize because there wasn't enough money. This appears to have infuriated Ms. Nyanzi, who supported the opposition candidate Kizza Besigye, and she began to attack the president and his wife. She also started a campaign to raise the money for the promised sanitary pads. Ms. Nyanzi's anger appeared in her Facebook posts. On January 27, she denounced Mr. Museveni as a \"pair of buttocks\" and said that Ugandans should be \"shocked that we allowed these buttocks to continue leading our country.\" On Feb. 15, she declared she would not call the president's wife \"Mama Janet\" as others do, asking: \"What sort of mother allows her daughters to keep away from school because they are too poor to afford padding materials that would adequately protect them from the shame and ridicule that comes by staining their uniforms with menstrual blood?\" Mr. Museveni has never hesitated to muzzle his critics, and he swung into action against Ms. Nyanzi. First her home was raided and threats issued; then Ms. Nyanzi was arrested. Her crime, according to the charge sheet, was \"cyber harassment\" for the first posting on Facebook, where she \"willfully and repeatedly used electronic communication to . . . disturb the peace, quiet, or right of privacy of his excellency the president of Uganda Yoweri Kaguta Museveni with no purpose of legitimate communication.\" She is now being held in a maximum-security prison in Kampala. Mr. Museveni has enjoyed close ties with the United States, and truckloads of aid. This should not give him the sense that he can ignore criticism of his actions. By putting Ms. Nyanzi in prison he is not only violating her right to speak up, but also locking up the hopes of girls in Uganda for a simple measure to keep them in school.

Chances are, no one is more anxious for him to leave Washington than residents of the capital, whose interests he has persistently tried to undermine. During his time in Congress, no member of either chamber has fought harder against home rule. We can only hope that whoever succeeds him as chairman of the committee with oversight over the District has more respect than he for the city's democratic rights. Mr. Chaffetz's sudden decision, disclosed Wednesday on his Facebook page, shocked the political world. He had, after all, just won reelection and was seen as a likely candidate for the Senate. The always-suspect explanation of wanting to spend more time with family seemed especially curious, given that he and his wife were about to become empty nesters. That he is choosing to walk away makes perfect sense, though, when viewed through the crass political considerations that have marked his career. Mr. Chaffetz rose to national prominence via his high-profile investigations as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. But the zeal for ferreting out supposed wrongdoing, which was on full display during the Obama administration and when Hillary Clinton was running for office, was nowhere to be seen when Donald Trump took office and questions immediately arose about conflicts of interest, violations of the emoluments clause or Russian connections. Now in the crosshairs of rising public discontent - becoming what the Deseret News called \"the face of Republican fecklessness\" - Mr. Chaffetz apparently saw retreat to Utah, and possible preparation for a run for governor, as the best way out. Such expediency doesn't come as a big surprise to D.C. officials and residents, since Mr. Chaffetz routinely tried to advance his political interests at their expense. How else to describe the hypocrisy of him holding himself out as an advocate for local control and less government while at the same trying to prevent the city from spending its local dollars and deciding local laws? In his first month in Congress in 2009, he testified against voting rights for the District, and in the following years he opposed budget autonomy, sought to overturn laws passed by the D.C. Council and once even threatened Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) with jail because of the city's legalization of marijuana. The District is right to celebrate Mr. Chaffetz's departure, but it should be wary. Those likely in line to take over as head of the oversight committee seem similarly antagonistic to the District. There is hope, though, in the fact that there have been Republicans in charge of the committee - Rep. Darrell Issa (Calif.) and former Rep. Tom Davis (Va.) - who turned out to be advocates for equal and fair treatment of the District and its residents.

When the Republican efforts to cover-up and slow walk the investigation started to go side ways they fired the U.S. Attorney in NY who had control of these investigations.  They hoped things would die there.  They were check mated by the NY AG's office who decided to take up the investigation and pursue it under the RICO statutes including money laundering between Russia, Cyprus,New York banks.

                "Chaffetz was terrible and wasted millions upon  millions of dollars on numerous investigations against Hillary on Benghazi when the first one told him she did nothing wrong.  Every single investigation showed that but he would not stop wasting our money.  Shame on him and republicans.  First of all Obama was president, not Hillary so they were investigating the wrong person but he kept investigating her because she was running for president.  so much for fiscal responsibility.  Now when there is real criminal activity by the republican president and collusion with an enemy, he has no stomach for getting to the truth.  why would anyone want to elect this lying coward who is just vindictive to anything.",

This last point is key. He's responsible for investigating the President's wrong-doings, which he's loathe to do. So he can leave Congress and do the things (above) to get ready to run, as well as avoid being tarred as the guy who wouldn't do his job when faced with the most corrupt and inept President in history. \n\nEasy choice.",

And this after 8 years of nothing but investigations of their opponents that led to nowhere.    How anyone can stomach the hypocrisy is beyond me.  I get queasy and lightheaded every time they speak or have a picture in the paper.   America will be even greater only after these slithering sorry excuses for representatives are removed from office.",

None.\n\nOn the other hand, he steadfastly refused to look into trump's potential conflicts of interest, nor that of his family members. To top it all off, he threatened the director of the Office of Government Ethics when he had the audacity to criticize trumps conflicts of interest.\n\nSo, I'm curious as to exactly what measure you use to deem someone worthy to run the oversight committee.

The term \"boujee\" comes from the culture of Atlanta, a predominantly black community. Boujee somewhat maintains its relation to the Marxian class system and use of \"bourgeois,\" but the term now relates more to colloquial words such as flexing or stunting. A black woman who is bad and boujee is a product of the \"black new South\"; she is unapologetically black, proud and fabulous. The fraternity's fundraiser was a play on a song by Migos, whose music revolves around Atlanta culture. Hell, \"Culture\" is the album title. I do not think this was necessarily cultural appropriation, but the event was coopting a cultural term. Most of the hype behind the event, which I applaud for its goal of raising money for a veterans' organization, came from the creative name. But the event would have used Atlanta culture with no real appearance of understanding or appreciation of that culture. It is unfortunate when people unnecessarily complicate matters, but even more so when people practice reductionism. American University messed up. Sigma Alpha Mu could do better. It wanted to use Migos's song to market its event, but the fraternity should not impose its own definition of boujee, disassociating Migos from the very Atlanta culture to which the group is proudly and inextricably tied.

(John Bazemore/Associated Press) NEW YORK - Max Scherzer will take the mound as scheduled Sunday night at Citi Field as the Nationals look to complete a sweep of the Mets and win their seventh straight game, but Washington's other ace won't pitch on turn this week. Stephen Strasburg last pitched Thursday in Atlanta, meaning he is scheduled to pitch on normal rest Tuesday against the Rockies. But Strasburg won't be utilized Tuesday in Colorado because he will be on paternity leave starting Monday as he and his wife, Rachel, await the birth of their second child. Players can go on the paternity leave list for three games, so the latest Strasburg will go back on the active roster is Thursday. Monday's starter is listed as \"TBA,\" and Joe Ross will get an extra day of rest by pitching Tuesday. Tanner Roark and Gio Gonzalez are scheduled for the final two games of the series in Denver. Strasburg figures to pitch again next weekend against the Mets at Nationals Park. Coors Field was the site of perhaps the worst outing of Strasburg's career last season when he allowed nine runs in 1 2/3 innings Aug. 17. He was then placed on the disabled list Aug. 22 with elbow soreness. He returned Sept. 7 but departed in the third inning with a pronator tendon tear. He didn't pitch again in 2016. Strasburg, who has a 2.89 ERA in four starts this season, won't have to deal with pitching in the high altitude this year. It appears that Jacob Turner will. The 25-year-old, who was selected eight picks after top overall choice Strasburg in the 2009 draft by the Detroit Tigers, was pulled from his start for Class AAA Syracuse on Thursday after not allowing a run over 1 2/3 innings without any apparent injuries. The Nationals haven't announced that Turner will start Monday, but Manager Dusty Baker acknowledged that Turner's early exit was in preparation for Washington's four-game set against Colorado. Turner yielded three runs in 10 1/3 innings over three starts for Syracuse after signing a minor league deal with an invite to spring training. He has started 53 games in the majors and appeared in 26 others since making his debut as a 20-year-old for the Tigers in 2011. As for Sunday, the Nationals will have their complete starting lineup for the first time since April 8 with Jayson Werth's return after missing three games with groin spasms. Trea Turner, who started his first game Saturday since coming off the disabled list, will bat second behind Adam Eaton again, and Ryan Zimmerman will bat fourth ahead of Daniel Murphy.

            "body": "President Trump speaks during a joint news conference at the White House on April 20. (REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque) Speaking in a video message taped for the meeting of the World Jewish Congress, President Trump noted the murder of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust, correcting his administration's omission of that fact from an International Holocaust Remembrance Day statement issued in his name earlier in the year. \"On Yom HaShoah we look back at the darkest chapter of human history,\" Trump said in the video, which was played Sunday night during the plenary assembly of the WJC in New York. \"We mourn, we remember, we pray and we pledge: Never again. I say it, never again. \"The mind cannot fathom the pain, the horror and the loss. Six million Jews, two-thirds of the Jews in Europe, murdered by the Nazi genocide,\" he added. \"They were murdered by an evil that words cannot describe and that the human heart cannot bear.\" The comments would not have drawn note had it not been for a statement issued by the White House to mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Jan. 27 that did not mention  the Jewish people. In the face of intense criticism from Jewish groups, the White House defended the decision, saying that it sought to take into account \"all of those who suffered\" during the Holocaust. Presidents of both parties typically addressed the murder of millions of Jews during the Holocaust in such statements. In his video remarks Sunday night, Trump spoke at length about the bravery and sacrifice of the Jewish people who were killed and the families who suffered during the Holocaust. He pledged that America will \"stand strong with Israel\" and he alluded to Iran, a regime whose threats against Israel he said cannot be ignored. \"We must stamp out prejudice and anti-Semitism everywhere it is found,\" Trump said. \"We must defeat terrorism and we must not ignore the threats of a regime that talks openly of Israel's destruction.\" \"We cannot let that ever even be thought of,\" he added. On Tuesday, Trump will headline the Days of Remembrance events at the U.S. Capitol, hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.",

He is a nuisance - an entertaining one if you're into conflict - when he talks trash to Paul Millsap. However, when he's making three-pointers, blocking shots and catching lobs, Morris becomes something greater and more difficult for Millsap to handle: a problem. The Washington Wizards can live with Morris irritating Millsap, but if they want to win two more games and end this series with the Atlanta Hawks quickly, they would rather see Morris bother Millsap with his play, not his antics. Since Morris posted 21 points, seven rebounds and four blocks in a Game 1 victory, he has struggled and Millsap has been mostly unemotional and surgical on the court. While both have talked smack to attrition during interviews, the actual competition has been more one-sided than it should be. The war of words doesn't matter, really. It's harmless and inconsequential gamesmanship. It's a mildly controversial sideshow, something to entertain those not fascinated by basketball alone. Ultimately, however, their on-court drama and postgame flexing hasn't changed what we already knew: Millsap is an all-star. And Morris is a wild card whose play either can propel the Wizards to the welcome mat of elite or keep them in an inconsistent state. [Wizards' Markeiff Morris calls Hawks' Paul Millsap 'a crybaby'] For a role player, Morris is quite influential. When the Wizards became a quality team in January, it coincided with Morris elevating his game. Small forward Otto Porter Jr. is still Washington's third-most important player because of his shooting and willingness to do the little things, but if you zero in on offensive impact, the Wizards are most dangerous when Morris uses his versatility at power forward and assumes the No. 3 scorer role behind John Wall and Bradley Beal. Morris finished the regular season third on the team in scoring at 14.0 points, just ahead of Porter's 13.4. Even though Porter is in line for a monster contract this summer, the Wizards have a different dynamic when Morris is more aggressive on offense. It makes Porter perhaps the most dangerous fourth option in the NBA (well, if you eliminate Golden State from the argument). It gives the Wizards better balance because Morris is a big man. Add center Marcin Gortat, a fifth option averaging a double-double, and you understand how the Wizards became so good offensively. The Wizards are so balanced that it often doesn't matter who's scoring the most. But when Morris is active and efficient, he changes the game. [Wizards says they must match Hawks' intensity in Game 4] \"It's his ability to score all throughout the floor,\" Coach Scott Brooks said, explaining Morris's impact. \"And his three-point shooting is a threat this year. It's something that he's worked on. From that four-spot, it's a sweet spot in the league, the way the league is playing, with all the shooters around and all the tough decisions that point guards make on the defense. You get a lot of good looks if you're a four-man who can make threes. And when he makes threes, we're tough to beat. When we took off in early January, the way he was playing had a lot to do with it.\" During his first full season in Washington, Morris shot 36.2 percent on three-pointers and averaged 6.5 rebounds, both career bests. When he took his game to another level in January, Morris was motivated because his agent relayed a Bleacher Report story listing the NBA's top 30 power forwards. Morris wasn't on the list. And so, as he told The Post's Candace Buckner, his attitude changed because of the snub. \"Murder,\" he said then of his reaction. \"Kill, kill, kill. Everything. No days off.\" Morris, with his beard and stern facial expression, can seem intimidating. But the more he opens up, the more you realize he's a thoughtful and charming 27-year-old attempting to put past mistakes behind him. It says something positive about the Wizards' culture and Morris's maturation that he has thrived here. It's easy to disregard his silly trash talk - he called Millsap a \"crybaby\" after Game 3 on Saturday - because you can see his substance now. But if he's going to talk, he needs to play better. The expectation shouldn't be that Morris beat Millsap head to head. Millsap is Atlanta's No. 1 option. Morris is a complementary player. Their numbers aren't going to be even, and games such as the series opener, when Morris outplayed Millsap in nearly every way, are going to be rare. But since Game 1, Morris is 5 for 17 from the field. He hasn't rebounded with the same vigor, and his defense has been just so-so. On the other hand, Millsap is averaging 25.0 points and 8.7 rebounds and shooting 54.8 percent over the three games. [Wizards-Hawks Game 4 preview] Clearly, the crybaby is dropping more than just tears against the Wizards. \"Me, as a man, you take your wins with your losses,\" Morris said during his infamous remarks after Game 3. \"I take my wins with my losses all the time. He just did more for his team. He's a crybaby. You get all the calls when you're a crybaby. That's how I look at it.\" Millsap says the feud is personal now. Although the two have been jawing since Millsap compared the Wizards' defense to MMA after Game 1, it still feels more like pro wrestling than a true, bitter rivalry. Real or imagined, Millsap has treated Morris like a gnat the past two games. It's hard to get inside the head of a 32-year-old veteran who plays with little emotion. Morris will keep trying, which is fine. But he has to get back to making Millsap work harder to defend him. And on the other end, Millsap will score, but he can't score so easily. Millsap shot just 44.2 percent in the regular season. The Wizards are making him look more dominant than he is. Morris has been appropriately physical with Millsap. But Morris can do a better job using his length and quickness to bother the Hawks star, too. Verbal spats are part of the playoffs, but so are quality players transferring their games to this stage. Morris, a playoff rookie, has mastered the smack exchange. Now he must do the latter. His game is why people care about what he has to say, anyway.

Morris does not want to be the brunt of this fan base ire if this team loses this series ( God forbid!!) Milsap is a very good forward who has carried this team's frontcourt this playoff series  and has averaged a double-double these three games so far. I hope Scott Brooks sends a message to Morris and the entire team sans John Wall who has been nothing short of brilliant all three games. Tonight's game is H-U-G-E!!", 
                "I thought that the Wizards had become a knucklehead-free zone.  Morris is putting that in doubt.  He needs to act like a man, not a pre-teen boy.  If he stays in defensive position on Millsap, he won't have to reach out and grab him as he blows by.  When he focuses on defense, he is capable.  When he is lazy and slow (see last two games), then he gets called for several early fouls and becomes a non-factor.  Brooks needs to go to Oubre at PF -- early!  Get this fool and his mouth on the bench and get someone on the floor who can guard Millsap (clearly Smith has no chance at that).  It might also help to put Porter on Millsap.",

                "I have to disagree about Millsap getting \"the call every time he touches the ball.\"  In games 1 and 2, that was not the case. Morris was allowed to bully Millsap in game 1 and the refs let it go. In game 2, the refs called it tight for both teams. In game 3, Millsap played more aggressive and Morris got in foul trouble early because he tried to do the things on defense that he got away with in DC. \n\nMillsap answered the bell, now it is time for Morris to put up of shut up. Period. \n\nOtto can only shoot the ball when he is passed the ball to shoot. Wall and Beal take a lot of shots and there are games when Otto just doesn't get the touches. I would argue that Beal needs to step up. Wall needs help on offense and Beal laid an egg in game #3.", 
                "Otto shot 43%, but only put up 7 shots. Morris put u[ 14 shots, Beal put up 20 shots and made only  6. Looks like Wall's mentality is to keep on giving them the ball, \"keep on shooting,\" rather than may be going to a different player when those two were cold?",

            "body": "TOKYO The United States and Japan have a historic opportunity to forge a strengthened partnership to confront Asia's mounting security and economic challenges, senior officials here say. But the Trump administration risks missing this opportunity because of its failure to embrace the need for a broader strategy. The administrations of President Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe share basic interests, common values and political objectives in a way that sets the stage for the closest bilateral cooperation since World War II. The two allies need to work together to deal with a rising China, confront a dangerous North Korea and manage explosive economic growth in Southeast Asia. But while the Japanese government envisions a strategic plan that would look over the horizon and account for the entire Asia-Pacific region, for now the Trump team is only talking about the North Korea crisis and specific bilateral issues. On both security and economics, the Japanese are asking the United States to think bigger and more broadly about what could be accomplished. On security, both sides agree that Japan should take a more assertive role and fulfill its decades-long drive to become a more normal, independent and self-reliant nation. Vice President Pence, visiting Tokyo last week, told me that the Trump administration wholeheartedly supports Abe's push for Japan to do more. \"The president would like to see Japan and our other allies in the world who have an ability to play a greater role in our common defense play that role and to bear that burden and I think that's consistent with that aspiration of the Japanese people,\" Pence said, adding he raised the issue of sharing the financial burden directly with Abe in their meeting. For Japan, paying more money for hosting U.S. troops is only one part of the discussion. As Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso noted after meeting Pence, Japan already pays a far greater percentage of the cost of hosting U.S. forces than any European ally does. In fact, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in Tokyo in February that Japan is a model country in that respect. What Abe wants is for Japan to build military capabilities needed to counter North Korea and also China, for example, by acquiring an offensive-strike capability and expanding Japan's missile defenses. That's politically difficult for him domestically and could require financial commitments the Japanese budget can't bear. But the project would benefit from more support from Washington. Tokyo also wants to join with Washington to strengthen the rules-based international order in the face of Chinese aggression in the South China Sea and the East China Sea, as well as Chinese military expansion throughout the Western Pacific. Maritime security is paramount for Japan. The Trump administration is pursuing a warming of U.S.-China relations, and there's a concern that relationships with key allies, including Japan, could become subservient to that drive. There's also a risk that by placing too much emphasis on getting Beijing to fix the North Korea problem, the United States could lose sight of the regional dynamic and also acquiesce to a wide range of China's bad behaviors. \"Japan and the United States should jointly address these issues,\" Kentaro Sonoura, Japan's vice foreign minister, told me. \"What kind of actions will the United States be willing to take? Will the United States be willing to stand on our side or not? These are indeed very important points of interest and concern for us.\" Several Japanese officials told me that they simply don't have interlocutors in the Trump administration yet. But their message to the United States is clear: While the short-term crisis is North Korea, the long-term challenge is China, and the alliance must not sacrifice the future for the present. On economics, similarly, the United States is thinking more narrowly than Japan is. Pence and Aso kicked off a new bilateral dialogue and agreed on a basic framework. Following Trump's withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, there's no clear message about what Washington wants the end result to be. Pence indicated there could be a bilateral trade agreement sometime in the future. The Japanese want to think bigger. The broader region is experiencing massive growth, especially in Southeast Asia, and the United States and Japan share an interest in ensuring that trade and investment are based on a rules-based system, as was envisioned by the TPP. By preserving the core of that agreement, free economies that value labor and other standards can compete, Sonoura said. Trump and Abe have formed a good personal relationship, and there is trust that both sides can build on. But if the alliance doesn't know where it is going strategically, there can't be a clear path to get there. The Japanese have their ideas. Now the Trump team has to step up.

First, many of Japan's neighbors are still anxious about Japan revisiting its expansionist, colonial aspirations.

But then he gums it up with allowing Cabinet members to visit the war memorial in Tokyo, talks of creating 'a beautiful  nation' that does not punish itself for its past, objects to S Koreans erecting statues to honor the Comfort Women who were sex slaves to the Japanese army during the war, etc.  He is more invested in appeasing his nationalist  right wing supporters than in truly resolving these festering wounds from 70+ years ago.\n\nSecond, Japan does not have the resources  to expand that much militarily.  Its economy is still in stagnation and it has a declining birth rate.  How will it pay for more 'offensive capability?' How is it going to get more young men to sign up for its military forces when there is already a shortage of manpower in the country?!?

That could advance the day of China's dream of federating with a democratic, capitalistic Taiwan.\n\nChina could solve the problem of N Korea with a conference in China, inviting the US, N Korea and S Korea.  N Korea would agree to stop overt provocations (but not give up its nukes).  The meeting would permit the Trump and Kim Jung Un to back off while maintaining face.

            "body": "Can U.S. politics still deliver in the public interest? A test case is taking shape in the Washington area. The test is this: Can the transit system of the nation's capital be saved? On one level, a rescue should be easy. Pretty much everyone, even people who don't use Metro, agrees that its demise would be a disaster. Pretty much everyone agrees that Metro desperately needs help. And while there isn't quite the same consensus on a solution, what needs to be done also is pretty well understood. Yet if you had to place bets right now, you'd be cautious wagering on a happy ending. And the reasons for that say a lot about the challenges U.S. politics confront across the country. Some of Metro's difficulties are particular to the system. Multiple jurisdictions, including two states, the federal government and the District of Columbia, help manage and support it, so no one official is accountable for its success or failure. But its problems more generally stem from a failure to face hard choices honestly that echoes loudly through state and federal governance. For years, Metro's overseers have been more inclined toward crowd-pleasing system expansion than needed but unsexy maintenance. For years, they were happy to buy labor peace by promising generous retirement benefits that would come due down the road, on somebody else's watch. For years, politicians have been unwilling to acknowledge that no modern transit system can support itself on fares alone but will need steady, dedicated tax revenue as well. The result, Metro General Manager and Chief Executive Officer Paul J. Wiedefeld said during a visit to The Post last week, is a system that was once the \"gold standard\" for mass transit but is now not even bronze. Wiedefeld, who took over in 2015, said it has been \"amazing to me that it could slip so far.\" Metro's operating costs are rising nearly twice as fast as its revenue, Wiedefeld said, and that is apart from $25 billion in capital needs - for new cars and the like - over the next 10 years. If something doesn't change, fares will keep rising while ridership and service decline. In his first 17 months on the job, Wiedefeld concentrated on safety improvements and intensive track repair. Now he has put forward a plan that would restore rail and bus service to sustainability. The plan asks all the jurisdictions to dedicate a source of revenue to Metro, as every other region with a transit system (including New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago) does. In return it would cap the growth of operating subsidies at 3 percent per year. It protects retirement benefits for existing employees and retirees, but would give a less cushy deal to those hired in the future. Work that is union now would stay union, but Metro would have the option to contract out some new components of the system, though unions would be allowed to compete for the work. There's something here to make everyone unhappy, in other words, and initial reviews rolled out accordingly. A union statement called the plan \"bad for riders, bad for workers and bad for the region,\" while Maryland's Republican governor grumbled about a statewide tax that nobody had proposed. (The burden would more likely fall on Prince George's and Montgomery counties.) That kind of first reaction is predictable. But here are some things to watch for next. Will local politicians have the courage to stand up to core constituencies for the common good? Will Democrats such as Maryland Reps. Jamie B. Raskin and Anthony G. Brown tell the unions that they are better off saving most of their jobs and benefits than driving the system into bankruptcy while waving the flag of purity? Will a Republican such as Virginia Rep. Barbara Comstock tell members of her party that Metro needs a dedicated tax, or will she be forever moving the reform goalposts? The federal government would be in big trouble without Metro. Will Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao step up? And if gubernatorial candidates in Virginia, state delegates and city council members in all three jurisdictions and U.S. senators from both states opt for compromise and honesty, will voters punish or reward them? The answer to that question could spell the difference between a prosperous, growing capital region and one that chokes on its own traffic as a $40 billion onetime jewel wastes away.

                "Back in the old days this was a rich country, and we paid enough taxes to build highways all over the place, put a futuristic subway system under our nation's capital, go to the moon, and support both medical and scientific research. Our future seemed limitless. But then our richest and greediest citizens decided they were entitled to thousand of times as much as the rest of us, and they paid the politicians to lower their taxes and tell people that when the rich men unzipped their fly, and the resulting liquid trickled down on us, that was sound economics. And so.... before you knew it our roads were falling apart, our magic capital subway system was breaking down, and things were generally going to hell in a footbasket. But the richest got even richer, and that was all that mattered, right? \nTHE END",

They would really rather sit in traffic than pay a little extra tax. The only solution I can see is a regional transportation authority that would have limited taxing power to raise money for all forms of transportation, not just Metro. That would not be constitutional in Virginia right now (don't know about Maryland; Congress would have to act for DC), so it would take a while to get it done.  But drivers will not vote for a tax for mass transit, and Metro riders will not support a tax for highway improvements, so only a combination approach has any chance.",

            "body": "President Trump and White House officials pressed congressional Republicans on Sunday to use the looming threat of a government shutdown to win funding for a wall along the border between the United States and Mexico, a top priority for the administration as it nears the symbolic 100-day mark. Trump wants funding to be included in a spending measure that would keep the government open past April 28, a determined effort that has prompted a possible standoff with lawmakers in both parties, who hope to avert a federal closure next weekend. Trump's push for fast action on his pledge to build the border wall is part of a mounting and, at times, tense scramble inside the administration to kick-start the president's agenda, even if it risks dire political consequences. It follows weeks of frustration within the White House over inaction and stalemates on Capitol Hill over big-ticket items such as health care and tax cuts. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said in an interview Sunday with The Washington Post that the president and his advisers remain \"strong\" in their commitment to securing funding for border security and a wall. \"This is what the president ran on,\" Priebus said. \"We want to get to a place this week where -border-security money is being directed to the Department of Homeland Security so that we can begin surveillance and preliminary work, and then we will keep working on getting DHS what it needs for the structure.\" \"The burden to keep it open is on the Republicans,\" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), above, said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"Building a wall is not an answer. Not here or any place.\" (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP) The timing promises a week of high drama on the Hill. The Senate returns Monday night, and the House returns Tuesday from a two-week recess, leaving just three days when both chambers will be in session to wrangle out a funding agreement. Negotiators worked throughout the break, but thus far a deal has not been struck. The wall, which experts say would cost $21.6 billion and take 3\u00bd years to construct, has emerged as a crucial sticking point for the White House, with the president insisting privately and publicly that progress toward its funding and eventual construction must be showcased this week. \"Congress is right to be nervous, but that's Trump's style to be aggressive, ambitious, right out of 'The Art of the Deal,' \" said William J. Bennett, a conservative commentator and close friend of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). \"Everyone seems to be getting used to that and how Trump doesn't want the half loaf but the whole loaf.\" In a tweet Sunday, Trump elbowed Democrats who have resisted his call to include wall funding. He chastised them for not wanting \"money from the budget going to the border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs\" and gang activity, in his view. Trump added that he would continue to ask Mexico to pay for the project, another bold proclamation he made during the campaign. Meanwhile, he said, he will press Congress for funding \"so we can get started early\" on the \"badly needed border wall.\" It remained unclear Sunday whether moderates within the GOP could persuade the White House to avoid a shutdown. Democrats have insisted that they will not vote for any spending bill that gives the White House money or flexibility to begin construction of a border barrier. They believe that the GOP will have to either abandon Trump's demand or assume political responsibility if a shutdown occurs. \"The burden to keep it open is on the Republicans,\" House -Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"Building a wall is not an answer. Not here or any place.\" (Bastien Inzaurralde/The Washington Post) Inside the White House on Sunday, West Wing aides made calls to congressional allies, while the president tweeted and reached out to several advisers, according to three officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly. Trump's tweets included a shot at Democrats in which he drew parallels between border-wall funding and continued federal payments for subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. Some Trump associates said that they believe Democrats may be willing to deal on border funding if those payments are put on the table this week during cross-party talks. \"ObamaCare is in serious trouble. The Dems need big money to keep it going - otherwise it dies far sooner than anyone would have thought,\" Trump tweeted. He later followed: \"The Democrats don't want money from budget going to border wall despite the fact that it will stop drugs and very bad MS 13 gang members.\" The tweets did little to assuage concerns created earlier in the day when White House budget director Mick Mulvaney suggested that Trump might not sign a spending bill that does not meet his demands. \"Will he sign a government funding bill that does not include funding for the border wall?\" Chris Wallace, host of \"Fox News Sunday,\" asked Mulvaney during a televised interview. \"We don't know yet,\" Mulvaney responded. Mulvaney said that the White House expects Democrats to cave on the border wall in exchange for guaranteed payments under the ACA. But Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) have already rejected a White House offer to build into the spending bill a dollar-for-dollar match in wall funding and federal health-care payments. Negotiators want the stopgap measure to keep government open by keeping spending flat, including money to keep the ACA going. Trump is hoping to open that up for negotiation in exchange for wall money. Democrats believe that voters will blame Trump for a shutdown, particularly if congressional leaders omit wall funding from a spending deal. Democrats and GOP leaders appeared to be nearing a spending agreement last week before Trump ramped up his demands. Aides hailed the budget talks as one of the only active discussions in which Democrats and Republicans maintained common ground. One clear area of agreement was not to include border funding in the stopgap budget. Democrats agreed to include other border-security measures, including money for new drones to patrol the border, but it was agreed that the wall itself should be debated separately, after the government is kept open. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is among a group of prominent Senate Republicans who have said publicly that they hope to avoid a border wall fight this week. \"I think that's a fight worth having and a conversation and a debate worth having for 2018,\" Rubio said Sunday on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"If we can do some of that now, that would be great. But we cannot shut down the government right now. Mulvaney's hard-line stance is also odds with a White House faction convinced that a government shutdown would be cataclysmic for an administration already struggling to prove its ability to govern, according to GOP aides in the White House and Congress who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing talks. Republican leaders have signaled that they will concentrate this week on keeping the government open, even if that means ignoring White House calls for action on other major priorities, such as rewriting the tax code and overhauling the ACA. Trump has pushed his staff in recent days to prod House Republicans for final revisions in a health-care proposal that can win support from both the hard-line conservative Freedom Caucus and the moderate Tuesday Group. And that task led advisers over the weekend to rely especially on three key players - Rep. Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), co-chairman of the Tuesday Group; Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the Freedom Caucus; and Rep. Patrick T. McHenry (R-N.C.), the House GOP chief deputy whip - to finalize legislation. But the White House's efforts to work directly with House coalitions and piece together a compromise health-care package has led to private unease on Capitol Hill, where some GOP members close to the leadership have grumbled that Trump aides are setting up the party for defeat or a stumble if support for the tweaked health bill is not as strong as the White House has suggested. Trump's advisers, aware of those concerns, still plowed forward Sunday on crafting the bill's language, citing the president's desire for action. There were ongoing conversations about the timing for a health vote, with Wednesday, Thursday, Friday or even sometime in early May, if necessary, discussed as options. Ryan addressed that pressure in a conference call Saturday afternoon, in which he told GOP members that while he hoped that they would continue health-care talks, his top priority will be the stopgap spending bill. \"Wherever we land will be a product the president can and will support.\" Ryan said, according to a senior GOP aide on the call.

With that logic, Americans shouldn't buy any packaged bread because Bimbo, a Mexican company owns Sara Lee, Entemann, Oroweat, Thomas, and about 3 or 4 more former US bread companies. Now, it is possible that Cruz Azul could have placed a bid, but Cemex is their major competitor. In fact, Cemex is in the top 3, with the other 2 also being foreign companies. Yet, any Mexican company to bid or work on the wall will face some harsh backlash because it is already being said that any that do will be considered traitors to their own country.

Bush in 2007. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Fence_Act_of_2006#2007_amendment\n\nThe existing 700-mile border fence is reportedly (by NPR) to only be completed on government-owned portions of land.  This is because it would take the Government a decade to obtain rights to all of the open stretches of private land required to complete the fence, and because it is physically impossible to fence off places like rivers and mountains.\n\nThe legal cases where private land owners refused to accept the Government's eminent domain fence reimbursements are in many cases still being litigated, especially in Southern Texas.  There are reports that the Government built fencing on private properties even before obtaining legal permission, therefore the percentage of completed fence coverage is unclear to me.\n \nThe same situation exists with President Trump's wall. All of the 700-miles of fencing would need to be replaced or supplemented by the wall, which could easily violate previously negotiated conditions of the sale of the land for the fence.  Republican land-owners/voters are not going to love a Government land grab.  \n\nAnd an additional 1,300 miles of animal migration would be disrupted, just as it was by the 700 miles of existing fence.\n\nBy the time the Administration takes the legal action to obtain all of the privately-held land along the ENTIRE 2,000 mile border, the Trump Administration will be over. Every private land-owner could represent a separate eminent domain court fight. \n\n\"Landowners Likely To Bring More Lawsuits As Trump Moves On Border Wall\"\n\nhttp://www.npr.org/2017/02/23/516895052/landowners-likely-to-bring-more-lawsuits-as-trump-moves-on-border-wall",

            "body": "Imagine if I began a column about Attorney General Jeff Sessions this way: \"I really am amazed that an attorney general who hails from a former Confederate state in the Deep South can issue a series of orders wrecking efforts to reform police practices, cutting back on voting rights and restarting the war on drugs.\" The specifics of what Sessions is up to are accurate, but that knock on the land of cotton would leave my inbox bulging with rebukes to bigotry against Dixie, and I'd probably get many YouTube links to Lynyrd Skynyrd singing \"Sweet Home Alabama.\" (Don't go to the trouble. I already have the song on my iPhone.) Yet the man whose job is to be the top lawyer for all of us said something very similar about a federal judge in Hawaii who blocked President Trump's travel ban. For the record, here is Sessions's islophobic sentence: \"I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and constitutional power.\" The obvious problem in Sessions's comments, made to conservative talk-show host Mark Levin (and unearthed by CNN's Andrew Kaczynski), is that Hawaii is a state like every other and has been in the union for 58 years, as Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) helpfully pointed out. Are newer states inferior to older ones? There is also the Trump administration habit of trying to discredit any judge who rules against it, the stuff of autocratic regimes. Members of the executive branch have every right to criticize and appeal lower-court decisions, but what Sessions suggested is that Derrick Watson, the federal judge in question, somehow lost his right to rule because of where his court is located. Hawaii has been a special place in conservative demonology because many on the right, once they had to concede that former president Barack Obama was actually born there and not in Kenya, wanted to hold on to the idea that he came into the world in a location that was, well, different. And Sessions may have picked up his anti-Hawaii cues from right-wing media, which reported that Obama had \"unexpectedly\" flown alone to Hawaii on March 13, two days before Watson issued his ruling, and that Watson just happened to go to Harvard Law School with the former president. A conservativetreehouse.com blog post asked: \"Coincidences? Or did President Obama travel to Hawaii to initiate, facilitate, or participate in the decision by Judge Watson?\" On March 16, Rush Limbaugh got the story out there and then insisted that he wouldn't traffic in speculation. \"I want to mention also Barack Obama has been in Hawaii the past few days,\" he said, but added, \"I don't know if Obama met with the judge.\" Nicely played, Rush. Here's one good thing that could come from Sessions's aloha-baiting: It might start focusing attention on the rest of that opening sentence and on the damage the attorney general is inflicting. Doing so would belie the idea that Trump is somehow becoming more \"moderate.\" Sessions has started switching the Justice Department's stance on voting rights cases, away from minority plaintiffs and in favor of states that passed discriminatory measures such as voter ID laws restricting access to the ballot. The new Justice Department stance did not stop U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos from declaring earlier this month that Texas's strict voter ID law \"was passed, at least in part, with a discriminatory purpose.\" Thank goodness Ramos can't be criticized as one of those island judges. Sessions also ordered department officials to review reform agreements between its civil rights division and troubled police forces nationwide, an Obama-era initiative aimed at restoring community confidence in the police after a series of shootings of unarmed black men. Jonathan Smith, executive director of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, called the move \"terrifying,\" but in a USA Today op-ed last week, Sessions invoked classic law-and-order rhetoric, saying he would \"not sign consent decrees for political expediency that will cost more lives by handcuffing the police instead of the criminals.\" And as Sari Horwitz reported in The Washington Post, Sessions is bringing back the old war on drugs, thus stopping in its tracks a once-promising criminal justice reform movement of conservatives, liberals and libertarians concerned with over-incarceration, particularly in African American communities. You don't have to live on an island to worry about what Sessions is doing in the name of justice. Read more from E.J. Dionne's archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

            "body": "The last thing President Trump now needs is for the stock market to go south on him. After all, he's got worries aplenty: abroad, North Korea, Syria, Russia and Brexit; at home, the stalled effort to repeal Obamacare and uncertainty surrounding \"tax reform.\" Compared with this tapestry of troubles, the stock market has been a splendid blessing. It's called the Trump Rally or the Trump Trade. By whatever name, it has been impressive. On Election Day, Nov. 8, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 18,332.74, not much different from a year earlier. By March 1, the Dow hit 21,115.55, a gain of 15 percent. Although stocks are slightly off this peak, the market increase remains about 11 percent and represents roughly $2.7 trillion of paper wealth, reports Wilshire Associates. To Trump, this must be immensely gratifying. Among other roles, the stock market serves as a general barometer of confidence that is independent of - and can't by manipulated by - Trump's nemesis, the detestable \"mainstream media.\" One message from the market, he doubtlessly thinks, is that he's doing much better than his vocal critics acknowledge. The theory of the Trump Rally is simple: He has brightened the economic outlook. Big business and personal tax cuts, combined with relief from over-regulation and higher infrastructure spending (roads, ports), will boost economic growth. Faster growth will raise profits - and higher profits tomorrow justify higher stock prices today. In theory, stocks represent the present value of (estimated) future profits. But there's the rub. What if those profits don't materialize? Immediately after the election, it was possible (though naive) to think that Trump could quickly convince the Republican Congress to pass his economic agenda. Now, that optimism seems unrealistic. The difficulty of repealing the Affordable Care Act showed the limits of the White House's power. Similarly, big tax cuts may be doomed by budget deficits. Progress on infrastructure and regulation is also grudging. So: If the main reason for the Trump Rally is missing, what's holding stock prices up? Good question. Let's be clear: Stock prices are historically high by many traditional measures. Consider the price-earnings ratio, or P/E. It shows the relation between stock prices and underlying earnings (profits). Since 1936, the P/E ratio of the Standard & Poor's 500 stocks has averaged 17 based on the latest profits and stock prices, says Howard Silverblatt of S&P Dow Jones Indices. Now, the P/E is almost 24. Stock prices have outrun profits' growth. According to Silverblatt, either added profits will materialize or, if they don't, stocks will decline. \"The P/E is high,\" he says. \"We are paying [in today's stock prices] for future and expected earnings. At some point, we need to see them.\" Stock valuations are tricky. With hindsight, the market can stay above or below levels reflecting economic fundamentals for long stretches. Whatever the case today, stocks are nowhere near the absurd heights of the \"tech bubble\" at the turn of the century. It's possible that a general improvement in the global economy justifies higher stock prices. The International Monetary Fund and some private economists have recently raised their forecasts. \"Compared with a month ago,\" says Global Insight, a major forecasting firm, \"[our predictions for economic growth] in the United States, Canada, Japan, Brazil, India and Russia have all been marked up a little.\" But the Trump Rally could be an exercise in over-optimism. Hefty expectations of tax cuts, regulatory savings and higher government spending may be disappointed, writes Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics. Or the rally could succumb to a foreign policy crisis. Take your pick: North Korea, the Middle East or others. If so, the rally could backfire. Rising stocks cause consumers to spend more; falling stocks curb their spending. Zandi figures this so-called \"wealth effect\" at about 5 percent: A $1 change in stock-market wealth prompts consumers to alter spending by about 5 cents. If the entire $2.8 trillion rally were erased, that would imply a $140 billion loss in consumer spending. Indeed, Zandi thinks the effect could be greater, because many heavily invested baby boomers - in or near retirement - \"would be very sensitive to a decline in stock prices.\" What may be holding up stocks is inertia, herd behavior or wishful thinking. One test comes this week when, says Silverblatt, nearly 200 major companies report profits for 2017's first quarter. Strong profits would vindicate the rally. For Trump and everyone else, the question is whether the rally rests on illusion or reality. Read more from Robert Samuelson's archive.

At best we can expect 2.5-3.0% if Trump does not screw up bigly.

It did so with steadily increased earnings.\nToday's Dow is a product of stock buybacks, HARP/TARP and QE policies that pumped hundreds of billions of dollars into Wall Street coffers. Never mind that the money was intended to boost the economy - Paulson, Bush, Bernanke et al. seemed sure that the cash would find its way to the street...not sure how that line of reasoning went, but obviously it failed. Instead, we now have a Dow at 20,000+, not based on anything like what grew the market from 1980-2006. Today's Dow is an average of corporate accounting tricks, a little more globalism, and all the cash that corporations have rat-holed during QE's tenure.

Over the multiple bubbles and crashes Ive seen since I started watching the markets, one thing I've learned is that when markets are trending in a particular direction, they tend to stubbornly continue in that trend much longer than the majority of analysts think is possible. Another issue is the economic mess in Europe and Asia. The uncertainty about the Euro and the entire European Union, may make U.S. investments, by comparison, look stable. My third point is that government gridlock often causes many to feel safer. I can't remember how many times I've heard investors say that if the politicians would only leave things alone, our economy would be fine. When they try to make changes with ill thought out plans, people get nervous. My last point is not meant to single out any particular party. Our nation has a general distrust of politicians. This is not a new phenomenon. Gridlock in Congress is often good news for investors.",

            "body": "Steve Kerr's presence on the Warriors' bench for the rest of the first round of the playoffs is in question. (Ezra Shaw/Getty Images) Steve Kerr, the Golden State Warriors' head coach, ruled himself out of coaching in Game 4 of its first-round series with the Portland Trail Blazers and on Sunday said his absence - due to ongoing symptoms from complications from a back surgery in 2015 - could potentially extend through the rest of the postseason. Kerr said his symptoms worsened several days ago, and that he's felt worse as the week went on. And after missing shoot around Saturday morning before Game 3, he decided he wasn't in good enough shape to take the floor with his team for the game Saturday night, one Golden State recovered from a double-digit second-half deficit to win. \"You guys saw me at the end of Game 2,\" Kerr told reporters during a news conference at the team's hotel in Portland on Sunday afternoon. \"I was very uncomfortable. I was uncomfortable at practice the other day. \"With things getting worse, I decided I couldn't coach. So, as of now, I'm consulting with my doctors, hoping for some improvement. And, if I get improvement, I'll get back on the sidelines. But I'm not going to that until I know I can help the team.\" What Kerr made clear, however, is that he did not believe a quick return and then having to go away again would help his team. Kerr told reporters he was hopeful he would return sometime within the next week or so and remain on the sideline for the remainder of the postseason, but said he wouldn't hesitate to remain away from the team for the remainder of the playoffs if the symptoms did not abate. \"I'm not going to do that to our team and our staff,\" he said. \"We're hoping over the next week or two - whatever it is - I can sort of make a definitive realization or deduction, or just feel that I'm going to do it or not.\" Last season, serious back problems sidelined Kerr for 43 games. Details of the issues he dealt with then were harrowing, involving leaking spinal fluid and debilitating headaches. Kerr had undergone offseason surgery to repair a ruptured disk, but complications forced him to have another procedure and take a leave of absence at the beginning of the season. \"I can tell you if you're listening out there, stay away from back surgery,\" Kerr said. \"I can say that from the bottom of my heart. Rehab, rehab, rehab. Don't let anyone get in there.\" When Kerr sat out last season, assistant Luke Walton took over head coaching duties and went 39-4 as the Warriors won their first 24 games en route to picking up an NBA regular season record 73 victories. But after Walton left the team at the end of last season to become the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, the Warriors made it a priority to replace Walton with a coach with head coaching experience in case there was a need for someone to fill in for Kerr this year. That's how the Warriors wound up hiring Mike Brown, who coached in Kerr's place Saturday night. Brown has spent parts of eight seasons a head coach in the NBA, including five with LeBron James in Cleveland and parts of two with Kobe Bryant in Los Angeles. He's won 347 games and made the playoffs six times, including reaching the NBA Finals with the Cavaliers in 2007 - the kind of experience the Warriors wanted to have at the ready in case Kerr couldn't be available, like he wasn't Saturday and won't be again Monday. \"Mike is fantastic,\" Kerr said. \"I was on the couch in my room saying 'We should put so and so in right now,' and that guy was going to the table. Mike and I are thinking along the same lines ... the whole staff is. We've gotten to know each other so well.\" Saturday was the first time Kerr missed a game this season. But now Kerr will miss the rest of this series and, barring a stunning Golden State collapse from up 3-0 on Portland, will possibly miss the beginning of the team's second-round series against either the Los Angeles Clippers or Utah Jazz. In the meantime, the Warriors - who, led by Stephen Curry, gave Kerr a game ball from Game 3 - will try to stay on course without him for however long he's away from the team. \"\u200eOur coach is going through a lot right now, physically,\" Curry told ESPN after Saturday's game. \"He told us this morning this is a situation where we need to rally and go out and win a game for him. But we felt that the way the game had gone, we had to fight and do it for him ... and the way that he said it was that we had to win one for the Gipper. So, shout out to Coach Kerr.\" Steph kept the game ball for Steve Kerr pic.twitter.com/7YDUZyUCqt - CJ Fogler (@cjzero) April 23, 2017 The question now is how much longer Curry will have to be shouting out Kerr in postgame interviews, rather than speaking to him on the sidelines during games. Judging by his comments Sunday, it could be awhile. Cindy Boren contributed to this report.",

            "body": "In 1943, when Refik Veseli, a photographer's apprentice, smuggled his mentor Moshe Mandil and Mandil's family across Albania to escape the Nazis, he didn't see himself as particularly heroic. Mandil, who had already fled the Nazis in Yugoslavia, was his friend, and it seemed natural to 17-year-old Veseli to help. Veseli's parents, who were Muslim, agreed, and they hid the Mandils and another Jewish family in their home in the village of Kruje for over a year as Jews were slaughtered across Europe. Had the two families been discovered, the Veselis could have been killed. But it never occurred to them to turn the families away. Like Albanians of all faiths, they followed \"besa,\" a code of honor that requires protecting guests with your life, regardless of their religion or creed, and treating them as part of the family. On Sunday, Holocaust Remembrance Day, Adas Israel Congregation in Northwest Washington honored the Veseli family and inducted them into its Garden of the Righteous, reserved for non-Jews who risked their lives to help Jews during the Holocaust. Veseli died in 2000; his wife and two of his children traveled from New Jersey and Massachusetts to attend the ceremony, which included Albanian and Jewish folk singing and the addition of the family's name to a plaque in the garden.

(Matt McClain/The Washington Post) The lessons of the Veseli family are particularly trenchant at a time when Muslims, including refugees fleeing danger, face opposition in the United States, Rabbi Gil Steinlauf told the congregation. \"We are living in dark times in this country and around the world, as hate crimes, vicious speech and bigotry - particularly against Muslims - is on the rise,\" he said. Noting that the synagogue had taken in a Syrian family, \"as your own people have done for us, we are prepared to do for you,\" Steinlauf said. \"We will not stand idly by while people in positions of power reduce you to hateful stereotypes; we will not stand idly by while leaders defame your sacred religious beliefs and practices, and as your own people have so nobly done for us, we are ready to do what it takes to protect you from any harm.\" After the ceremony, congregants at the Cleveland Park synagogue approached the family to express gratitude. \"It's an honor,\" Andrew Davis, who had come with his 13-year-old son, Sammy, said to Veseli's wife, Drita Veseli, 86. \"Thank you for what your family did.\" Nechama Liss-Levinson, a visitor from Great Neck, N.Y., said she thought the choice of honorees this year was particularly relevant. \"There's been so much Islamophobia and fear of refugees,\" she said. \"As a Jew living in America it was very illuminating to see that in their Koran there's this idea of [helping those in need]. It's a totally different view of Muslim religious obligation than what we see repeated nowadays.\" Imam Yahya Hendi, a Muslim chaplain at Georgetown University who attended the ceremony, said it brought him to tears several times. \"Jews know what pain is and know what it is to be turned away,\" he said. \"Hearing that the Jews of America will stand up for the Muslims of America, those were powerful words - that we're all in this together.\" While there were gentiles across Europe who risked their lives to help the Jews, there was a different quality to the way it was done in Albania, said Floreta Faber, the country's ambassador to the United States. While most Jews in hiding stayed invisible, \"in Albania they were in the open, as 'friends,' or 'guests,' or 'cousins from Germany,' \" she said. There was not a single known case of a Jew in Albania being turned over to the Nazis, and Albania was the only Nazi-occupied country in Europe that had more Jews at the end of the war than at the beginning. At one point during the occupation, there was a report that the Nazis had left. \"Everyone went out and celebrated, and that's when everyone learned that my family had been giving shelter to two Jewish families,\" said Refik's son, Bujar Veseli, 59, who attended the ceremony. The report turned out to be mistaken, and afterward the Veselis were terrified that the Nazis would show up at their door. But no one betrayed them. \"It wasn't just our family; it was all Albania that protected them,\" Bujar Veseli said. After the war, Refik Veseli and Moshe Mandil worked together briefly in Belgrade, and Mandil offered to bring his friend to Israel as his own son, but instead Veseli returned to Albania. There, during four decades of communist rule, contacts with the outside world were seen as subversive. \"The government did not allow us to talk about this; we discussed this only with the family,\" Ermira Hoxha, Veseli's daughter, said of her family's actions during the war. Veseli was able to exchange only a single New Year's card each year with Mandil. \"Before we could receive this greeting card, my father had to go to the government and explain who was this person, and this happened every year.\" But in the privacy of his home, \"he was hungry always to speak about them, and he was always talking to his three children about what happened,\" Hoxha recalled. \"He said, 'Don't forget you have a father and brother and sister over there.' \" The two families eventually established an Albanian-Israeli friendship organization that located other Albanians who had helped Jews during the war. In 1987 and 2004, members of the Veseli family were recognized as Righteous Among Nations by Yad Vashem, the organization in Israel that honors non-Jews who helped Jews during the war. But Veseli never saw his old friend again; by the time he and his parents were allowed to travel to Israel, Mandil had died.",
